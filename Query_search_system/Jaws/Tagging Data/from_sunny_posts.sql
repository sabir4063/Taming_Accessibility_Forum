 moving by headings, paragraphs, forms, tables, lists,   graphics, and regions,   are available. more navigation quick keys will be   supported in future   updates.         by default, jaws uses semi-auto forms mode in edge, which turns on forms     mode automatically only when you move to a form control using tab or     shift+tab.  due to the way edge displays pages, auto forms mode is not   available as it   is possible to have multiple controls on a single line. you   will need to   press  enter to turn on forms mode if you use the arrow keys   to move to form   fields.         other familiar jaws features that are currently supported include:         list of 4 items  . displaying a list of links, headings, or form controls   by pressing   insert+f7, insert+f6, or insert+f5.  . searching for text on   the current page by pressing ctrl+f.  . obtaining font information by pressing   insert+f.  . the ability for jaws to detect changes in the language used on a   web page   and automatically switch to the appropriate voice if   available.  list end         as you begin using edge, one important item to note is that edge is a   modern   app with no menu bar that can be accessed using the alt key. to   access edge  specific features, press tab from the bottom of a page or   shift+tab from the   top. continue using tab or shift+tab to move through the   various controls  until you cycle back around to the content area.   alternatively, edge offers   many of the same shortcut keys found in other   browsers such as ctrl+t to   open  a new tab, ctrl+h for history, ctrl+i for   favorites, ctrl+j for downloads,   and so on.         other changes  list of 16 items  . resolved stability issues reported   by multiple customers using jaws with   outlook 365.  . addressed a reported   issue with audacity, a popular sound editor, where   the application would   stop working when attempting to open an mp3 file with   jaws  currently   running.  . this update contains changes necessary to support firefox version   57,   scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2017. firefox users must     update  to jaws 18.0.4321 to continue using this browser when it updates   to version   57.  . added the latest brailliant bi display drivers from   humanware to support   their brailliant bi14 braille display.  . resolved a   customer reported issue with the ups tracking research it   lookup source not   displaying any results.  . in internet explorer, addressed a customer reported   issue with jaws not   always reading the correct label on form controls when   navigating using tab.  . resolved an issue where jaws was not correctly   loading settings for office   applications when office 365 was installed   through the windows store.  . addressed an issue with jaws not reading the   contents of a book in the   kindle for pc app.  . in the latest version of   outlook 365, addressed issues with jaws not   reading as expected when   navigating in the list of suggestions that displays   when  typing a   contact\'s name into a new message or calendar appointment.  . resolved a   customer reported issue where changes to voice profile settings   were not   being honored for the dectalk usb hardware synthesizer.  . addressed an issue   with both the dectalk express and dectalk usb hardware   synthesizers where   jaws would unexpectedly close when performing a sayall   from  a web   browser.  . when running jaws and zoomtext together in windows 7, resolved an   issue   where zoomtext\'s focus tracking was not working properly on the secure     desktop  or the logon screen.  . jaws visual tracking is now enabled by   default when navigating windows   html help content such as the jaws   help.  . a customer reported that jaws was not working as expected with a     particular java application. this issue has been resolved.  . resolved a   reported issue with the german version of jaws not working as   expected after   attempting to print or close a document in word 2013.  . fixed braille output   issues with hebrew.  list end           take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my   ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license   agreement.  in the   end you have to ignore everything, &amp;

(1924, 'braille displays and multiple languages/character sets', 'hi brian,    there are several things to consider when choosing a braille display nowadays.  1. if the display is going to be used as a stand-alone device, will the language in question be supported by a possible speech synthesizer?  2. does the screen reader in question have the necessary braille tables to display said language?  most of the time, you can find braille tables elsewhere if that should not be the case. jaws used to habe jbt files you could copy to have them show up in the braille translation combo box, but more recent versions of jaws and or nvda use recent liblouis translation tables.  i suppose the same would hold true if you were using contracted braille in whatever language, but that\'s a question of settings and braile tables again.  3. if the device has stand-alone braille input, how good is its back translation from contracted braille into standard writing?  some devices offer a feature where you type contracted words and these are then translated back into normal words. this is very useful if you have to type a lot of text fast.  i cannot tell you what display offers the best or good results there, since i don\'t own anything super recent.  note: i\'m mostly refering to devices that are computers themselves here, notetakers with interpet capabiities, etc.    when it comes to keyboards, some people may prefer actual keyboards with the symbols on them, provided they have enough vision to make out anything meaningful.  there are companies that sell keyboards with larger font sizes for vision impaired users.  as for me, i completely killed the us english keyboard and am just using the german and spanish ones.  the us keyboard has all the different punctuation symbols elsewhere when compared to the rest of europe, so spanish is very close to the german layout in that regard, just y and z are where you\'d expect them on a us keyboard.  another benefit of the spanish keyboard is that i can produce all sorts of accented letters fairly quickly.  i memorised the layout spending some time in spain, others may have different approaches to multi-lingual input.  what language is your client going to use?  braille displays also have dot commands or menus where you can change character sets and braille tables.    hope that was somewhat helpful.    regards,  nermin', 'following', 'tagged', NULL, 'undefined', 'undefined', 'undefined', 'undefined', 'undefined', 'Junk'),
