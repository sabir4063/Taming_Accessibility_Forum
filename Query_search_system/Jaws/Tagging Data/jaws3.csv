"381","ability to read pictures or screen shots?","good morning,     i am aware of the ability for jaws to do some ocr.  can someone explain how that works, and what it can actually read?  here s why i ask.     a friend recently posted two different things on my wall.  technically, he thought i d be able to read them because it s text.  however, it s actually a picture of text that was posted.  he found and shared it.  it s either that or a screen shot.  i ve never explored or used the ocr capabilities of jaws but am beginning to wonder if i could use it for such pictures.  if so, how do i go about doing this?  any thoughts on this in general?  thanks again.  jim","original","tagged",NULL,"Help","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined"
"382","ability to read pictures or screen shots?","hi jim,           here's the information from jaws  help:           convenient ocr  frequently, you will encounter  images that contain textual information.  these can include a pdf file, the  setup screen of an application, or the  menu of selections for a dvd movie.  while these images contain text that is  readable by a sighted person, jaws is  unable to read the text as it is part  of the image.           the convenient ocr (optical character recognition)  feature enables you to  access any image on the screen that includes text, or  recognize all of the  text in a pdf document. with just a few simple  keystrokes, jaws will  recognize the image in a matter of seconds and activate  the jaws cursor so  you can navigate the resulting text. the recognized text  will be in the same  location as the actual image on the screen. in order to  differentiate the  recognized text from other text that may be in the window,  jaws will use a  different voice when it encounters the recognized text. when  you activate  the pc cursor, or switch to another application or dialog box,  the text is  removed and you will need to perform the ocr again.         if you open a pdf document and there is no text  available to read, you can  perform a keystroke that will recognize the entire  document and place the  resulting text into the results viewer for reading.  you can then use  standard reading commands to review the text or select and  copy sections of  content for pasting in other applications.         to use convenient ocr, the following layered  keystrokes are available:         insert+spacebar, o, d. recognizes the currently  open pdf document.  insert+spacebar, o, w. recognizes the current application  window that has  focus.  insert+spacebar, o, s. recognizes the entire  screen.  insert+spacebar, o, c. recognizes the currently selected control,  such as a  graphical button.  insert+spacebar, o, q. cancels recognition  while it is in progress.  insert+spacebar, o, question mark. speaks a brief  help message describing  the commands in the ocr layer.  the following  examples illustrate just some of the uses of this feature.         you insert a dvd movie into your computer which  brings up a menu allowing  you to select from various dvd features. you press  insert+spacebar, o, w and  after a few seconds, jaws will alert you that ocr  is complete. at this  point, the jaws cursor will be active and you can  navigate around the screen  using the arrow keys and read the text of the  menu. when you hear the option  you want, press numpad slash to perform a  left-mouse-click, or insert+numpad  plus to route pc to jaws to activate the  option. prior to jaws 13, this menu  would have been completely  inaccessible.  note: depending on the type of screen the dvd displays and the  quality of  the text, the convenient ocr may not always work. some dvd screens  will be  recognized better than others.         you open a pdf in adobe reader which turns out to  be inaccessible. press  insert+spacebar, o, d to have jaws begin recognizing  the entire document.  after several seconds, the contents of the pdf file are  displayed in the  results viewer for reading. use standard reading commands to  review the text  or select and copy sections of content for pasting in other  applications.  for example, you could select all, then copy and paste into a  microsoft word  document, which you could then save.  note: the ocr process  takes longer for larger pdf files. as text is  recognized, it is added to the  end of the existing text already in the  results viewer. this allows you to  continue reading without interruption as  the document is processed. if you  are currently not reading using say all,  jaws announces the current line as  new text is added to the results viewer  to indicate that ocr is still in  progress.         note: if the pdf document requires a password, you  will be prompted to enter  it when you first press insert+spacebar, o, d. you  must enter the correct  password before the ocr process will  continue.         you try to install or use an application whose  interface is not accessible,  such as acronisr true imaget home 2011 or 2012.  if no text is readily  available when pressing tab or when using the jaws  cursor, you can try  convenient ocr. start with the pc cursor and press  insert+spacebar, o, w to  recognize the text of the welcome screen graphic.  you can then use the jaws  cursor and numpad slash (left mouse button) to move  to and choose what are  possible buttons and links.  if you are not getting  clear recognition results or you find that text is  running together when you  recognize the current screen, window, or control,  refer to faq 63556 for ways  to optimize performance. when recognizing a pdf  document, convenient ocr does  not use the physical image that is currently  visible on the screen, so the  recognition results feature a higher degree of  accuracy since they are not  affected by the current screen resolution.         note that to correctly recognize text in other  languages, you can configure  the primary and secondary ocr language. the  convenient ocr settings are in  the main tree view in settings center. when  you expand this item, you have  primary recognition language and secondary  recognition language settings.  use the spacebar to cycle through the  available languages until you hear the  one you want, or press f6 to move to  the combo box and select a language.         when you install jaws from the program disc, the  ocr components are  automatically installed. if you download jaws from the web  site and have an  active internet connection when you begin the installation,  the ocr  components will be downloaded during the install. if you do not have  an  active internet connection when you install jaws from the web download,  a  message is displayed at the end of the installation stating that  some  components were not installed. to use the ocr feature, establish an  internet  connection and run the installation again so the ocr components  are  downloaded.              take care.  mike  global warming?  most likely caused from hot air  generated by

"508","accessible media players","also, before or playing a file, pressing r toggles the repeat feature on   or off.    when playing a file and the sound sounds like it's coming out of one   speaker more than the other, you'd need to reset the balance to 0 which   effectively balances  the sound to come out of both speakers. so   pressing control+alt+k sets the balance to 0%, control+alt+j (50%) or h   (100%) sets the balance to the left speaker, and control+alt+l (50%) or   semicolon (100%) sets the balance to the right speaker.    while a file is playing, press control+j to jump to a specified time to   play. specify the amount of minutes followed by a colon and the number   of seconds you want to start playback from. there is no specifying of   hours, so if the time you want to jump to is 2 hours and zero seconds,   you'd type 120:00 and press enter.    and if you want winamp to jump to a different time, jumping to a sertain   time always starts from the beginning, effectivly 0 minutes and 0   seconds. so if you decide you want to listen 10 minutes into the file,   you'd type 10:00. but if what you want actually starts 20 minutes   instead of 10 minutes into the file, you'd type 20:00.    you can also have a bunch of audio files in a folder and have winamp   play those files without creating a playlist. select all of the files   you want and press enter.    if you play a playlist, pressing b advances playback to the next track   and z moves and plays the prior track within the playlist (m3u, pls or   asx files).    there's alot you can do with winamp. these are just some i heard of but   don't use regularly.","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Elaboration","undefined"

"534","accessible password managers","password safe doesn't automatically fill in login forms but it does allow you to very easily copy either your username or password (but not both at once) to the clipboard.  if you include the url for the website for which a given username/password applies there's also a built in ""browse to url"" function or you can use the ""go"" button in the password entry creation/editing dialog to have it fire up in your default browser.  have a look at  http://www.howtoanswer.com/manage-and-store-multiple-passwords-with-password-safe--148.html   this page is accessible even though it's screen shot intensive.  the narrative does a pretty good job of describing what's being done at various steps as far as creating entries, etc.  also, as an aside, what i call the portmanteau method of creating passwords is a way to create complex passwords that are easy for you to remember and horribly difficult for other people to guess.  what you do is construct a ""standard password"" out of parts that are significant to you, combined with something that's simple to remember about your website, that will differ based on where you're using it.  password length is something that adds a lot to password strength, so the longer the better so long as it doesn't become a pain to enter (unless you're using something like password safe to store and copy/paste them, then you can go crazy, but i still generally key mine in by hand so i use portmanteaus that are easy to remember.  let's say your childhood home was located at 1523 betsy bell drive.  your favorite pet was your cat, fuzz.  your grandmother's given name was nancy.  your preferred special character is an asterisk.  for a given website you could create the portmanteau:  nancyfuzz&lt;site specific something here&gt;1523*.  when you already know the nancyfuzz is at the front and the 1523* is at the end it becomes very easy to get passwords like nancyfuzzgmail1523*, nancyfuzzmybank1523*.  you can use phrases that no one else would know instead of constructions like this, e.g., hastemakeswastegmail1523*.  it's a matter of coming up with something that's very easy for you to remember as far as the general construction rule, but that would be virtually impossible for a random person who isn't you to guess.  it's amazing how quickly one becomes at typing the ""repeated parts"" of even long portmanteau passwords.  it also allows you to create something that's distinct to virtually any purpose without any two of them being exactly the same.  --       brian                  a great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.           ~    saul bellow   ,  to jerusalem and back","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"

"715","action keys mode - a warning to those buying certain new laptops","for all i know the following may apply to some desktops and/or all-in-ones, too, but i've not yet encountered it in these environments.  since the beginning of the laptop, convention had been that the function keys across the very top of the keyboard required the fn key that's nested along the very bottom of the keyboard to be held before hitting a given function key to make it perform whatever function the manufacturer defines for that key.  most people are familiar with function keys to do things like:  volume up, volume down, mute, wireless on/off, brightness up, brightness down, etc.  there is a new feature that hp, at least, calls ""action keys mode"" which turns this convention on its head.  when activated, this makes a simple press of a given function key trigger its function rather than being passed along to whatever application as a key press.  this can have some ""interesting"" effects for screen reader users.  this function is currently enabled by default on my laptop and the f6 key so happens to be the mute on/off toggle key.  when using nvda, if i press f6 it simply toggles the mute state.  in order to make it behave as f6 normally would i must hit fn+f6.  this does not apply if the shift is pressed along with f6 in order to reverse the direction.  that works perfectly well.  i can only imagine the chaos this could unleash if you start using the various commands that employ the function keys on a system with action keys mode activated.  action keys mode can be disabled, but it is controlled via uefi/bios.  on my machine one disables it by activating the uefi menu by doing a repeated esc key press during boot and selecting f10 choice.  once the old-fashioned bios-like screen pops up, you have to transition to the system configuration pane and arrow to the action keys mode entry and disable it.  since this is done well before the operating system is even involved, i don't know of a single screen reader that could be active to accomplish the task.  since this mode is controlled by the hardware ahead of any intervention by anything else, you must disable it if you wish your function keys to operate ""the way they always have.""  brian","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

'tis the nature of the beast that bios updates are an all or nothing affair.  that being said, even though your machine may have bios updates available from the manufacturer, don't be in a big hurry to apply them if the machine is behaving the way you want it to and the way it always has.  patches to bios tend to occur as the interaction between it and the os or some application program uncovers a bug.  if you're not doing the thing that causes that bug, and your computer use routine follows a pretty consistent pattern, you're not likely to run into an issue unless you start doing something different than usual with software you've not used before.  brian","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

(i'm giving him a hard time as we have been having conversation off  list.)    mario, let me help you out.    if you're using adblock plus on  internet explorer, the installer is a good old-fashioned execute file. it  creates a folder in program files, which is what mike referred to earlier. in  that sense, it is a program of sorts. and the way you edit the settings for  internet explorer is from an html document in that folder, which is the address  mike referenced.    brian is correct that in firefox (and presumably in  chrome too) it's an extension or add-on. so you are correct that it doesn't  create a program folder for you. however, brian can see things we can't see,  like toolbars. so he's directing you to a toolbar which would be perfectly  correct if you could find it. i wish we could access it that way, because  hovering over that toolbar button shows you the number of ads blocked on the  current page, which i think would be kind of fun to see. but it doesn't work  that way for us. the good news, however, is that in firefox, on the tools menu,  at the very bottom--right below options--is an adblock plus submenu (as jaws  reads it), that will take you to the options screen. you don't get to see how  many ads have been blocked, but you can easily manage your settings that  way.  hope that clears up any confusion.  brad              take care.  mike  this email was sent from my,  ibarstool.         take care.  mike       take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my  ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license  agreement.  in the end you have to ignore everything, &amp; click i  agree.","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Elaboration","undefined"

"810","adding favorites in firefox","the difference is that if you know how to do it, you can make a shortcut to your favorites folder, and without having to open your browser first, you can click on a favorite and go directly there. with a bookmark, you can't do that, because there is no way to get to your bookmarks without opening the browser first. this way, it's like being able to open a favorite, and every favorite becomes a temporary home page in the browser.  bill white billwhite92701@...","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"

"832","adding voices","i'm so glad this seems counterintuitive to you.  this comes up periodically on this list.  i think i'm the last to have encountered this problem.  there were lots of good suggestions, but none worked.  technical support at freedom scientific walked me through the following.  i'm guessing you are talking about the vocalizer expressive 2 voices.  they actually don't show up anywhere one would expect.  go to the jaws menu (jawskey + j), then activate the ""options.""  after that, go to the voice adjustment menu.  you will see some software synthesizers, including eloquence.  you will have a vocalizer expressive voice installed.  you probably already had one installed.  so, it looks like nothing happened.  well, that may be true, but it probably is just the counterintuitive way freedom scientific set this up.  i'm guessing you are looking for susan, allison, or one of the other voice persons. they are there; they are just hidden.  arrow down to the vocalizer expressive synthesizer.  then press alt + v.  you might have to tab once (i don't remember specifically, but you are not more than two tabs away after you hit alt + v).    i think you can now arrow up and down to pick your voice, e.g., susan or alison.  arrow down to pick the voice you want to use (at least part of the time).  then, do the most important thing of all!  tab over, way over, until you come to a ""save as"" prompt.  at that point save this ""person"" as a synthesizer, e.g., susanvoice or alisonvoice.  then hit apply and ok.  now, when you do a voice adjustment, you will have synthesizers that match the name and settings for the ""persons, e.g., susanvoice.""  by the way, you do this process even if you downloaded the big files individually.  remember, the compressed voices all come in one file.  i'm guessing you downloaded the big files that are linked to the ""person"" names.  that, in fact, is what fooled me.  i downloaded susan, and i illogically thought i would find a file installed as susan.  not so.  all the voices are tucked away in the vocalizer expressive menu.","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"

"843","adding voices","in theory, i agree that there is some logic to the idea of selecting the synthesizer first and then the person, and if i (and the several people  who have been stumped by this two-step process) had simply downloaded the compact voices for the vocalizer synthesizer in a single file, none of us would expect to find anything besides  vocalizer  in the list of synthesizers.  so, i agree with you up to this  point.        the problem arises when a separate file is required for each of the  high premium  voices.  one must separately download files for susan, allison,  and so on.       then, when one goes to look for those files, they don t exist.  all that exists is  vocalizer,  which one might assume (and several have assumed)  related to the old vocalizer 1 synthesizer for jaws 17 and before.  that susan, allison, and the others were separately downloaded suggested that, perhaps, they were, in effect, separate synthesizers.  nowhere in any documentation are we told that, though  these voices are downloaded as separate files, they are, in fact, really only parts of the same vocalizer synthesizer.          it is the process of seemingly hiding the separately downloaded files that threw me off, and i think several others have been flummoxed by the same  thing).","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Elaboration","undefined"

"928","advanced searching in outlook 2010 - opinions sought","i generally prefer to teach keystrokes to access the required ribbon options to accomplish something, but this time i might make an exception.  once you're in an outlook folder you wish to search it's a simple matter to hit ctrl+e to be thrown into the search box.  after that things become much more complicated.  if you want to search on the from field, the keystroke sequence to do this is alt+js+om, then one types in the partial or full name or e-mail address one wishes to search on.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""from,"" open parenthesis, the partial or full name or e-mail address, and a close parenthesis directly in the search box to accomplish precisely the same thing.  if you want to get only messages that have attachments, the keystroke sequence to do this is alt+js+h, and that creates a search only for messages that have attachments.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""hasattachments:"" followed immediately by either ""yes"" or ""no"" and can filter for messages that either do or do not have attachments directly into the search box.  if you want to filter by date, the keystroke sequence is alt+js+w, this brings up a drop down menu from which you can choose today, yesterday, this week, last week, this month, last month, this year, or last year.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""received:"" followed by one of the previously listed single words or two-word phrases.  all of the above can, of course, be combined together.  there are also additional criteria that can be specified but i'm trying to focus on the most common and useful.  let's say i'm trying to find an e-mail that i sent to you, last week, that has an attachment on it.  i can do one of two things after hitting ctrl+e:  1.  immediately type ""from(brian vogel) received:last week hasattachments:yes"" in the search box by hand.  2.  hit alt+js+om and immediately type ""brian vogel,"" then hit alt+js+w and use down arrow to go through the dropdown to find last week, then hit alt+js+h  the second option is, to me, much more cumbersome than the first, once you know what the search operator terms and formats are.  in addition, it is only through hand entering ""hasattachments:no"" that one can limit the search to messages that do not have an attachment, no keystroke sequence generates the ""no"" condition.  i'm sure that some of you have had to use advanced searching to filter out as much extraneous e-mail in your archives as you possibly can before trying to locate a specific message from the returned results.  what say you regarding whether it makes more sense in this case to focus on the search operators that you type yourself versus the keystrokes and typing involved to do each via the ribbon?  brian","original","tagged",NULL,"Help","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined"

applications key.     your  instructions    then said to press control + d to open the documentation.  alas!  that is    when things stopped working.  the cursor jumped to a line in the  actual    default script source code at the point for    decrease braille       i    thought    you perhaps meant to say alt + d, but that did not work either.  i  think    i   ll try the help file.  i feel i   m pretty close.        someone else on the list (i do not remember who it was) suggested  using    windows to make the switch.  alas!  that seemed to require running    another    program.  this is the firm   s laptop, and to run an executable file  that    is    not part of the firm   s image takes an act of congress, a year to  wait,    and    the actions of someone in our it department who

been no problem.  i just go to  keyboard    manager, choose to send the applications key, and assign that  function to    the print screen key.  it was that easy in jaws 16.  i just tried  doing    it    in jaws 17 (not my favorite version), and i found keyboard manager  had    changed entirely.  i suspect jaws 18 will have the same completely    baffling    changes to keyboard manager.        i do not remember any mention that jaws 17 completely screwed up  keyboard    manager.        regardless, has anyone tried to translate this relatively simple  function    into the brave new world of jaws

"1227","any good audio editors that work with jaws?","jim,              if by ""clean up"" older recordings made from vinyl there may be other, and easier, options than audacity (though i can't speak to accessibility off the top of my head).  i had a kit that included some hardware that allowed the making of those recordings easier, but the software applied to them after the fact was pretty remarkable for removing pops, etc.              i have not looked at all the filters available for audacity recently.  if you'd like me to do so to see if there are now specific ones aimed at doing what you propose i'll be happy to do so or to send you the links where you can start ""drilling down"" into what is available.              audacity as a whole is not, in my opinion, simple.  but if you have a certain set of activities that you're routinely using it for it becomes simple once you have the routine down.  brian","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"
"1228","any good audio editors that work with jaws?","you'll want things like the vinyl restoration and click and crackle removal tools in sound forge for this, so that's a good direction to look. a good quality noise reduction plug-in is also helpful, and normalization is also nice to make sure nothing either jumps out at you or can't be heard. i've also found that auto-cropping tools are useful too when converting from analog media to digital.  i've done a *lot* of this type of stuff, including cleaning up things from some pretty rough recordings.","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"
"1229","any good audio editors that work with jaws?","nicole,            i ask the following for my own edification, but have you looked in to the current plug-ins supported by audacity?  this is the  main audacity plug-ins wiki page  and here is the more basic, but still extensive  plug-ins page at the main site .  i've known that the ladspa plug-ins exist for a long while, and that there are over 90 of them, but the documentation regarding exactly what they are and do is poor.  there are also the nyquist plug-ins, too, along with a number of others that will be meaningful to someone of your experience that leave me scratching my head.            i think that things may have expanded greatly since you last gave audacity a look.  since it's free, along with all it's plug-ins an add-ons, it's a great option for someone who wants to get into this but at minimum outlay.  you could probably give a pretty decent synopsis regarding what audacity coupled with the plug-ins is capable of.  i certainly can't, and would appreciate it, if you have the time, if you would.  i realize you may not have the time.  brian","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"
