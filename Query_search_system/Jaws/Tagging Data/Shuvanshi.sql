    (2689,'classic firefox theme',' i found this just now and thaught it might fix the wevism problem folks are having.  i recently installed firefox 29, which added several new features to the popular browser.    these are mainly a combination of user interface-related goodies and stability improvements. for example, users can now enjoy redesigned tabs and the ability  to customize the front-end by adding more buttons and functions.    firefoxlogo    while these customization options are definitely welcomed, however, firefox almost always seems to  break  or change something that didn t need to be touched  in the first place.    firefox 29 issues    the latest firefox 29 stops you from performing several, seemingly basic things that could frustrate those who are picky about their customization options.    among these changes include the inability to move the reload button from its default place or see the status bar the same way you used to.    the reload button now sits to the right of the address bar, while the status bar only shows items when they are installed.    additionally, it s important to note that the so-called status bar is now called the add-on bar.    the issue with the latter (at least in my case) is the fact that some of my frequently-used add-ons are not yet compatible with the latest firefox version  or its visual overhaul.    initially, i thought the best way to restore firefox to its former glory was to downgrade to a previous version. while this option technically works, it  is counter-intuitive.    then i found a firefox plugin (or add-on) called classic theme restorer.    what does classic theme restorer do?    the add-on performs a lot of the things that are shockingly unavailable in the latest firefox update. for example, you can move the reload button and restore  the old status bar (add-on bar) to the way it looked before. additionally, you can place your tabs toward the very top of the browser or underneath the  menu bar.    thankfully, all of my favorite features were working again when i installed classic theme restorer. this includes plugins/add-ons that were no longer functioning  under the new user interface.    note that the current firefox version remains the same; the plugin merely restores its former visual settings.    how to install classic theme restorer    click here   to download classic theme restorer.    click  add to firefox  followed by  allow  from the subsequent pop-up menu.    theme-restorer-add    theme-restorer-install    restart the browser when asked, and voila! you are all set with its installation.    how to customize firefox options    click the  tools  menu from the menu bar, then click  classic theme restorer.     customize any desired option as you see fit, including browser tab positioning and the inclusion of the classic status bar (again, now shown as the add-on  bar.)    theme-restorer-tools-menu    as you can see, every option you modified works like a charm again   including the return of the classic status bar:    theme-restorer-customize-screen    how to move firefox items    simply click an empty area toward the top of the browser (such as the empty space next to the menu bar) and then click  customize.  you will be greeted  with the following screen:    theme-restorer-dialog    drag and drop any of the available items on the main screen to the top of your browser. otherwise, drag and move any existing buttons at the top and drop  them anywhere you wish.    theme-restorer-customize-screen    i hope this helps anyone looking to move the firefox reload button, restore the classic menu bar and any other feature missing from this latest update.    ~ adrian ','original',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

    (2835,'communication theory','             we seem to have some challenges of late comprehending one another on     this list. it happens, especially in written communication. but if     you all will forgive the intrusion, i feel the need to explain a     fundamental concept of communication theory so we can get back to     the business at hand--which is helping one another with our jaws     issues. so please forgive me for what i hope will be helpful to all     in terms of promoting constructive communication. although much of     the following answers brian''s prior message, i hope we can all learn     something from the following--i know i did just in writing it.          my "sighted response" comment was more of a slightly sarcastic way     of saying, "but you''re missing the point. we can''t get there from     here, or at least, we don''t know how to get there from here."          point #1: i want to say that your descriptions of things are     generally useful, at least for someone like me who appreciates     understanding what my sighted friends are seeing. as i have     explained, what jaws says and how it says it doesn''t always     replicate the layout that you see, and since i do what you do in     reverse--that is, teaching sighted people while being blind     myself--i find the visuals useful. having said that, they''re not     always relatable--not because you''re not good at it, but because of     something called frame of reference, which i will describe below.          point #2: i think some context may be helpful. while i don''t presume     to speak for anyone on this list because people are all different, i     think it''s probably fair to say that most of us have experienced     well-meaning people who want to help, but keep forgetting on some     level--conscious or subconscious--that our reality is not theirs.     case in point, i spent an hour showing someone my issues with the     ribbons, and no matter what i did, she kept trying to solve the     problem with the mouse. as you know, that''s not an option for me,     but she couldn''t break the habit. in the end, i got my point across,     but it was an intensely frustrating hour in which my blood pressure     probably went up twenty points.          so as i read your response to adrian''s questions, and you kept going     back to the icon at the bottom of the screen and the popup menu, my     reaction was, "but he can''t, or doesn''t know how to, get there from     here." it''s like i told my friend with the ribbons, "it''s great that     you can see it and you can get there, but how does that help me?"          your subsequent answer was helpful, as adrian pointed out, because i     never think to try shift f6. in my limited experience with the afore     mentioned problem, when i opened a pdf, i was trapped and could go     nowhere. but i never tried f6 or any variant thereof.          my degree is actually in communications, not computers or taxes or     anything i do now. but the first core concept we''re taught, both in     communication theory and in interpersonal communications, is the     concept of frame of reference. basically your frame of reference is     the sum of all experiences you''ve had. so while i have no direct     experience with having sight, i do have knowledge of things that     people have told me or described to me over the years. each person''s     frame of reference is going to be different. some of us have sight.     some of us used to have it. some of us never had it. some of us have     had things described to us in a way that we have a pretty good idea     of what it looks like, while others have no such concept.          so when i say, "that''s a sighted response," it''s really not a slap     in the face. it''s actually supposed to be a joking way to say,     "there''s a piece of that puzzle that i''m missing because you''re     talking in visual blahblahblah that''s not in my frame of reference,     although every sighted person in america would probably have gotten     it; hence, a sighted response''. try again." your second effort was     much more successful as adrian pointed out.           likewise, sometimes we forget that you''re not working directly with     jaws all the time, and there are things you can''t relate to because     they''re not in your frame of reference. as an example, for me on all     of my computers, firefox will lose focus and jaws will say,     "netscape dispatch wnd." i don''t know why or what it means. it just     happens. you''ve probably never seen that, because as far as i know,     that phrase is never on the screen. i just live with it, hit the tab     key to regain focus, and go on with my life. but if i asked how i     could get rid of this "netscape dispatch wnd" message, you''d     probably think my computer was on drugs, because "netscape dispatch     wnd" is probably not in your frame of reference and certainly not on     your screen.          so to brian, i apologize if you took my remark as a slam; it was     never intended as such. there may have been a touch of frustration     in there because it does get tiresome when people recommend things     you can''t do, no matter how well-meaning the intent. and to the rest     of us, we''ve got to realize that every person on this list has a     different frame of reference. so something that''s a part of your     daily existence may never have been experienced by the other person     across the keyboard, and that''s not just because we''re blind or     sighted. it''s because our collection of experiences is unique to us.          i really don''t intend to start a thread with this. it just seems     that these kinds of miscommunications seem to be happening with     greater frequency, so i thought a little communication theory might     help. please note that any responses to this message or any other     probably won''t be read until late tomorrow night, as i''m working a     full day in a tax center tomorrow.          so back to jaws, and remember that my frame of reference is not and     never could be entirely yours.          brad    brad@...

using her pack mate for reading book files to be proofread. she''s a braille proofreader with the education service center region 20. thanks to our networking business we bought a braille-edge 40 from hims inc. and paid cash on the nail for it along with the executive case. when the deal was done we spent over $3000.00. thanks again to our networking business we were able to skip the rehab line. hims has been paid in full for this device and the executive case.                         in order to do her work more efficiently when she works here she wants to connect the braille-edge 40 to her laptop in order to read files directly from that computer.                         yesterday we tried connecting the braille-edge 40 to the laptop and interface it with jaws for windows 2018. first we''re not sure if the braille-edge driver is included in jfw 2018 or if we still need to install the driver on the cd that shipped with the unit.                         first we selected the "braille-edge" driver in braille options in jfw and added it to the list of braille displays and made the braille-edte the default braille display. at no time did jfw prompt us to install the braille-edge driver leading us to believe that the driver shipped with jaws 2018. we also restarted jaws after adding the braille-edge so these settings would take effect as directed.                         after this process was completed mary turned on the braille-edge 40 and attempted to put it into "terminal mode." she was able to select terminal mode but could not activate it using the commands given in the braille-edge 40 manual. we''re not sure if the braille-edge 40 should have been turned on before or after jfw was restarted so jaws would recognize it so mary could begin reading her documents directly from the laptop.                         we attempted to contact both vfo and hims for assistance with resolving this issue. vfo kept us on hold for ages and we gave up in disgust. when mary tried calling hims all she got was a recorded message. we have already had negative tech support experiences with hims. mary had some other questions. instead of receiving a callback all she got from them was an e-mail message giving her the steps to address the issue in question. at least vfo keeps their support lines manned with live agents who can be very helpful when you can connect with them. considering what we spent with hims wee expect the same level of service from any assistive technology company we do business with.                         since hims has an office in austin and san antonio is only a 2-hour drive from austin there should be no problem for them to send someone down here to help us resolve this issue particularly since it''s an employment-related matter. the only braille-edge user we know lives in dallas. if there are braille-edge users in the san antonio area that can assist us please contact us so mary can have this situation resolved before she starts work when her spring break is over. here is our contact information:         peter and mary donahue:    phone: (210) 826-9579    e-mail:    mary: braille@...

decide to buy a mac to avoid a situation like this in the future.                         we thought that the inability to reach tech support might have been due to their being at csun as that conference occurs in march. further investigation indicated that csun doesn''t begin until later this month. hims should have never left itself volnuurable to being called out on the internet. having their phones manned with live tech support would have insured that this message would never have been posted to these lists particularly since we paid cash for the braille-edge 40 and the executive

we''ll be fixed too. thanks for reading. here''s hoping someone particularly someone from hims will contact us to help us out. all the best.         peter donahue                      from:

more i can stay out of the proverbial cloud, the better. that''s the reason why version 6 is subscription-based. you''re paying that monthly fee for somebody to maintain your password vault on somebody else''s server, which, in my unhumble opinion, is a compromise. i don''t like, never have liked, the idea that cloud-based backup means you give your data to somebody else to hold for you, somebody you don''t know and think you should trust just because they say you should. take this to its ultimate extreme, and you''d be right in saying that i don''t like banks either. having worked for two for twenty-six years, what goes on behind the teller''s window could fill a book. yes, they pay you for the privilege of parking your money there, but the things for which that money is used, and how the return on your loan of that money to the bank, called and investment, is gotten, well, it''d curl your hair. it sure curled mine! so keep your data out of the cloud as much as you can. back up your password vault and give it to a relative to hold, or someone else whom you can really trust, someone who won''t charge you for the service.      on 3/7/2018 9:04 am, john gurd via

update:  5/26/2018]             if you have never used the groups.io website, you will need to follow the instructions just below to get a password so that you can log in to the site.  otherwise jump straight on to the section,   advanced preferences for your group subscription  , for the preferences that give you precise control over the messages you ll receive from groups.io, and in what format, afterward review the section,   groups.io message reply and other options sent in individual messages and digests  .   note:  the easiest way to log out of the groups.io web interface is simply to enter     https://groups.io/logout     in the address box of your browser and then navigate to that page.  you don t need to locate the link showing your name, activating it to get the drop down menu, then choosing log out from that menu.                   getting a password to log in to the groups.io website          if you ve subscribed via e-mail you have a groups.io login id, your e-mail address, but you ve never been assigned a password for the website.  to get one:        1.      in your web browser, go to the groups.io main site login page:     https://groups.io/login         2.      find the  forgot your password?  link and activate it.        3.      a page with a single edit box, e-mail address will open.  enter your e-mail address in it.        4.     navigate to the one and only button on the page,  email link to log in,  and activate it.        5.     watch your e-mail, including your spam/junk box, for a message from groups.io that will contain a link you need to activate that takes you to your groups.io profile page where you set your password.  this is the password you ll use to log in to any groups.io group webpage where you wish to do something, such as changing your preferences, that requires you to be logged in to do.  you are, at this stage, actually logged in.                                                  advanced preferences for your group subscription          adapted for screen reader users by timothy wynn                   these preferences allow you to get  very  precise control over what messages you will receive in e-mail from groups.io and the format in which you ll receive them .  you can significantly decrease the amount of e-mail you receive from high-traffic groups while also being able to decide what''s important enough to keep an eye on.       once you get to the main groups.io webpage,    https://groups.io   , you will need to navigate to the "log in" (two words) link and activate it. once you''ve entered your username, which is the e-mail address you''ve used to subscribe to the group(s) you routinely read, and password, activate the "log in" button and you will be taken to the "your subscriptions" page.         if your browser window is not already maximized, do so now (keyboard shortcut is alt+space, then x or windows+up-arrow).         if the page is restored or minimized, then at the top of the page you''ll see a button labeled "toggle navigation", followed by a link with a graphic labeled "groups.io". this version of the interface will not allow you to edit any of the subscription preferences as far as i can tell.      if the page is maximized, then the top of the page should have a link with a graphic labeled "groups.io", followed by a link labeled "your groups".         use your screen reader''s table navigation commands to move to the first table found on this page. the columns should read "group", "# members", "latest message", and "delivery". move to the row for the group for which you wish to set up your advanced preferences, navigate over to the delivery column, and activate the link found there.  this will bring up the subscription page which contains the advanced email preferences.   you will have to start back at this step for each group for which you wish to set up the advanced mail preferences.       just so you''re aware these are on the subscription page, there is a radio button cluster for the  email delivery  options: all messages, full featured digest, plain digest, daily summary, special notices only, no email. this is immediately followed by two checkboxes related to using a signature: use signature for web posting and use signature for e-mail posting. these are followed by the signature edit box, should you wish to set up a signature that goes on to all your messages if you check one of the previously mentioned checkboxes.      use your screen reader quick navigation command to find  and  activate the "advanced preferences" heading level 3 link.      there are three major sections to the advanced preferences:         message selection. there are two radio buttons: all messages and following only. if the first is selected then every message sent to the group will be sent to you in the format you selected for e-mail delivery. if you select following only then the only messages you will receive are messages you''ve chosen to follow. there is a checkbox associated with "following only," "first message also." if this checkbox is checked it serves as a selective override such that the first message in any new topic is sent to you so that you can see it and elect to follow it with the link at the end of the message if you wish to keep monitoring this topic.      replies. there is a checkbox, "auto follow replies," which will make any topic that you start yourself, or any topic in which you reply to a message, followed. this checkbox is generally only used if you have elected to use the "following only" feature for message selection.      max attachment size (only for groups that allow attachments). this is followed by a dropdown box that allows you to choose from four different maximum sizes for attachments to be delivered to you via e-mail. the default is unlimited size. if you''re using an internet service with data caps you may wish to change this. if you choose the zero option it means that all attachments will be stripped before a message is sent to you.         find the "save" button and activate it to save these settings.         as you can see, if you choose a setup where you have elected to get messages with the "following only" option combined with the "first message also" checkbox this will greatly decrease the flow of e-mail you receive while allowing you to decide for each topic whether you wish to follow it to receive further messages or not. if you do nothing then you will not receive any additional messages for that particular topic unless you hit the link to follow it at the end of the message or reply to it, if the "auto follow replies" option was checked.                      groups.io message reply and other options sent in individual messages and digests        at the   end of each individual  message   is this collection of links:      1.            view/reply online    followed by the groups.io message number assigned to that message.      2.            reply to group    (which you ll probably never use since a straight e-mail reply does the same thing)      3.           reply to sender   .  this is how to send a private message to the person who sent the message you re currently reading.  activating this link will fire up a new message in your e-mail client of choice, including web based ones if you have that set up, and will put the e-mail address of the digest snippet s sender in the  to:  field and put  private:  followed by the actual topic s  subject  line after it.        4.           mute this topic

    b.           group home      which will take you to the groups.io home page for the group this message originated from.      c.            contact group owner    -  uses the mailto command to cause a new, blank e-mail message to be created with the group owner address of the group already filled in.       d.            terms of service       e.           unsubscribe from this group      which throws you into the groups.io web interface for unsubscribing from the group where this message originated.      at the   end of each digest message   is a collection of links:      1.            view/reply online    followed by a count of messages in that topic already.      2.            reply to group    (which you ll probably never use since a straight e-mail reply does the same thing)      3.           reply to sender   .  this is how to send a private message to the person who sent the message in question to the group.  activating this link will fire up a new message in your e-mail client of choice, including web based ones if you have that set up, and will put the e-mail address of the digest snippet s sender in the  to:  field and put  private:  followed by the actual topic s

(the last keystroke     opens the placemarker list. select temporary from the list, and then choose     the move to button.)      selecting between the temporary placemarker and the cursor position    to select text between a temporary placemarker and your current position in a   web page, html document, or word document, do the following:       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to set a temporary placemarker.       navigate to another location on the web page or document, then press      insert+spacebar, m . all text between the temporary     placemarker and your current cursor position is selected and ready to be     copied to the clipboard.      this method is often easier than using the  shift key  in   conjunction with the  arrow  keys when attempting to select large   blocks of text.    adding permanent placemarkers to web pages or html documents    to add a placemarker, do the following:       open a web page or other html document.       move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put     the placemarker.       press  ctrl+shift+k  and then  enter .       the add placemarker dialog box opens with focus in the name edit field. it     contains text that appears at the cursor location. if you want to change the     placemarker name, type a new name in this field; otherwise, press      tab  to move to the next control.       the define for all pages on current domain check box is cleared by     default, which allows the placemarker to be anchored only to the current web     page or html document. if you want to use this placemarker so that it is     anchored to all pages within the current domain instead, press      spacebar  to select the check box. press  tab      to move to the next control.       the anchor to text check box is cleared by default. select this check box     if you want to link the placemarker with specific text, such as a heading,     that appears on the page. this can be useful on frequently updated web pages     where text and elements tend to drift from their original position. when     selected, the next control, anchor text edit field, automatically populates     using the original text in the name edit field. this guarantees that the     placemarker will always be associated with this text on the web page.       press  tab  to navigate to the ok button and press      spacebar  to close the dialog box and save the placemarker.          renaming placemarkers    to change the name of a placemarker, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to rename.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of placemarkers on     this page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select the placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the change name button or press      alt+c .       enter a new name for the placemarker and then press  spacebar      on the ok button.      removing placemarkers    to remove one or more placemarkers, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to delete.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of all placemarkers     on the current page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select a placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the remove button or press      alt+r  to delete the placemarker.       tip:  if you want to delete all placemarkers   for this page, press  spacebar  on the remove all button or press    alt+l .    important placemarker concepts    the following sections, placemarker keystrokes, temporary versus

. only one temporary   placemarker may be set per web page. if you later decide to move the temporary   placemarker to a different place on the web page, just move the virtual cursor   to that new location and press  ctrl+windows key+k  again.    if you want to make the temporary placemarker permanent, press    ctrl+shift+k  to open the placemarker list dialog box and add it   to the list, which lets you keep and maintain multiple placemarkers on the web   page, html document, or form. the last location where you set a temporary   placemarker is saved until you move it again, or remove the placemarker from the   placemarkers list dialog. you can browse to other web pages, exit jaws, even   restart your computer, and your temporary and permanent placemarkers are   preserved.    url versus domain placemarkers    jaws lets you assign placemarkers to either the current web address (the url   displayed in the address bar) or domain (the overall web site name). the url   (uniform resource locator) is the web address displayed in the address bar. you   can only use placemarkers assigned to the current url when you are visiting that   page.     individual web pages are contained within a domain. the domain''s name is   usually the first portion of the page''s web address and ends with .com, .net,   .org, .gov, .edu, or similar suffix. when you add a domain placemarker to a web   page, you can use that placemarker on any page within the current domain. since   many sites use a consistent design for all of their pages, the placement of   links, graphics, buttons, and form fields is often similar. if this is the case,   you can use a single domain placemarker to navigate many other pages on the   site.     for example, if a web site has a search box located at the top of each page,   you can put a domain placemarker there named "search." you can then use this   placemarker to move to the search box on any page in the domain, regardless of   the url.    advanced placemarker usage    the following describes other ways to customize and display placemarkers.       sharing placemarkers    you can use settings packager to share your placemarkers for a web site with   other jaws users. settings packager is a program that lets you save speech and   sound schemes, placemarkers, and personalized web settings in a compressed .zip   file that you can send in an e-mail message, post on a web site, or copy to   removable storage media. you can also use settings packager to import the   settings contained in these .zip files into jaws. to start settings packager,   press  insert+f2 , select "settings packager," and press    enter . for more information on using this program, open the   settings packager help menu and choose help topics.    to share your placemarkers with other jaws users without using settings   packager:        open your jaws user settings folder from the start menu, all programs,     jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws, explore my     settings.       move to the placemarkers folder and press  enter .       placemarker information is stored in .pmi files. locate the .pmi file with     the same name as the page containing the placemarkers you want to share.       copy this file and distribute it to other users. these users then need to     copy the .pmi file on their placemarkers folder by going to the start menu,     all programs, jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws,     explore my settings and open the placemarkers folder. the users can now     navigate that html page with your placemarkers.      custom page summary    when you open an html page, the custom page summary feature automatically   lists each placemarker on the page and its associated text. this lets you   quickly review the text located near your placemarkers so you can hear any   changes or updates to those areas of the page. to enable or disable this   feature, do the following:       open settings center ( insert+f2 ) or quick settings     ( insert+v ).       in the search edit box, type "placemarker" without the quotes.       press  down arrow  to move to custom placemarker page     summary in the filtered results of the tree view. (note that for web browsers,     this option appears in both the virtual cursor options group and the     personalized web settings group.)       press  spacebar  to toggle through the following settings.             select "speak placemarkers on page load" to have jaws read the name of     each placemarker on the current page as well as the text that appears near the     placemarker''s location.       select "list placemarkers in results viewer on page load" to have jaws     display the placemarker information for the page in the results viewer. the     results viewer provides a link with the name of the placemarker and the text     that appears near the placemarker''s location on the page. you can use the      arrow  keys to move to a link and then press      enter  to move to that placemarker.       select "do nothing" to have jaws provide a custom page summary.       see also:      placemarkers   in word                    back                    next             take care.  mike        take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my   ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license   agreement.  in the end you have to ignore everything, &amp; click i   agree.

information:     from the website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crowdfunding      crowdfunding     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia     crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the internet.[1] crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and of alternative finance. in 2015, it was estimated that worldwide over us$34 billion was raised this way.[2][3]     although similar concepts can also be executed through mail-order subscriptions, benefit events, and other methods, the term crowdfunding refers to internet-mediated registries.[4] this modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who proposes the idea and/or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the "platform") that brings the parties together to launch the idea.[5]     crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range for-profit entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, or community-oriented social entrepreneurship projects.[6]           contents  [hide]   1

philosopher auguste comte[7][unreliable source?]  crowdfunding has a long history with several roots. books have been crowdfunded for centuries: authors and publishers would advertise book projects in praenumeration or subscription schemes. the book would be written and published if enough subscribers signaled their readiness to buy the book once it was out. the subscription business model is not exactly crowdfunding, since the actual flow of money only begins with the arrival of the product. the list of subscribers has, though, the power to create the necessary confidence among investors that is needed to risk the publication.[8]     war bonds are theoretically a form of crowdfunding military conflicts. london''s mercantile community saved the bank of england in the 1730s when customers demanded their pounds to be converted into gold - they supported the currency until confidence in the pound was restored, thus crowdfunded their own money. a clearer case of modern crowdfunding is auguste comte''s scheme to issue notes for the public support of his further work as a philosopher. the "premiere circulaire annuelle adress e par l auteur du systeme de philosophie positive" was published on 14 march 1850, and several of these notes, blank and with sums have survived.[9] the cooperative movement of the 19th and 20th centuries is a broader precursor. it generated collective groups, such as community or interest-based groups, pooling subscribed funds to develop new concepts, products, and means of distribution and production, particularly in rural areas of western europe and north america. in 1885, when government sources failed to provide funding to build a monumental base for the statue of liberty, a newspaper-led campaign attracted small donations from 160,000 donors.[8]     crowdfunding on the internet first gained popular and mainstream use in the arts and music communities.[10] the first noteworthy instance of online crowdfunding in the music industry was in 1997, when fans underwrote an entire u.s. tour for the british rock band marillion, raising us$60,000 in donations by means of a fan-based internet campaign. they subsequently used this method to fund their studio albums.[11][12][13] in the film industry, independent writer/director mark tapio kines designed a website in 1997 for his then-unfinished first feature film foreign correspondents. by early 1999, he had raised more than us$125,000 on the internet from at least 25 fans, providing him with the funds to complete his film.[14] in 2002, the "free blender" campaign was an early software crowdfunding precursor.[15][16] the campaign aimed for open-sourcing the blender 3d computer graphics software by collecting $100,000 from the community while offering additional benefits for donating members.[17]                 indiegogo''s logo.  crowdfunding started to gain mainstream traction with the launch of artistshare (2003).[18] as the model matured, more crowdfunding sites started to appear on the web such as kiva (2005), indiegogo (2008), kickstarter (2009), and microventures (2010).[19][20]     the phenomenon of crowdfunding is older than the term "crowdfunding". according to wordspy.com, the earliest recorded use of the word was in august 2006.[21]     types[edit]     the crowdfunding centre''s may 2014 report identified two primary types of crowdfunding:  1.rewards crowdfunding: entrepreneurs presell a product or service to launch a business concept without incurring debt or sacrificing equity/shares.  2.equity crowdfunding: the backer receives shares of a company, usually in its early stages, in exchange for the money pledged.[22]     reward-based[edit]     reward-based crowdfunding has been used for a wide range of purposes, including motion picture promotion,[23] free software development, inventions development, scientific research,[24] and civic projects.[25]     many characteristics of rewards-based crowdfunding, also called non-equity crowdfunding, have been identified by research studies. in rewards-based crowdfunding, funding does not rely on location. the distance between creators and investors on sellaband was about 3,000 miles when the platform introduced royalty sharing. the funding for these projects is distributed unevenly, with a few projects accounting for the majority of overall funding. additionally, funding increases as a project nears its goal, encouraging what is called "herding behavior". research also shows that friends and family account for a large, or even majority, portion of early fundraising. this capital may encourage subsequent funders to invest in the project. while funding does not depend on location, observation shows that funding is largely tied to the locations of traditional financing options. in reward-based crowdfunding, funders are often too hopeful about project returns and must revise expectations when returns are not met.[10]     equity[edit]     equity crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations through the provision of finance in the form of equity.[26][27] in the united states, legislation that is mentioned in the 2012 jobs act will allow for a wider pool of small investors with fewer restrictions following the implementation of the act.[28][29] unlike nonequity crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding contains heightened "information asymmetries". the creator must not only produce the product for which they are raising capital, but also create equity through the construction of a company.[10] equity crowdfunding, unlike donation and rewards-based crowdfunding, involves the offer of securities which include the potential for a return on investment. syndicates, which involve many investors following the strategy of a single lead investor, can be effective in reducing information asymmetry and in avoiding the outcome of market failure associated with equity crowdfunding.[30]     software value token[edit]     another kind of crowdfunding is to raise funds for a project where a digital or software-based value token is offered as a reward to funders which is known as initial coin offering (abbreviated to ico). value tokens are endogenously created by particular open decentralized networks that are used to incentivize client computers of the network to expend scarce computer resources on maintaining the protocol network.[31] these value tokens may or may not exist at the time of the crowdsale, and may require substantial development effort and eventual software release before the token is live and establishes a market value. although funds may be raised simply for the value token itself, funds raised on blockchain-based crowdfunding can also represent equity, bonds, or even "market-maker seats of governance" for the entity being funded.[32] examples of such crowdsales are augur decentralized, distributed prediction market software which raised us$4 million from more than 3500 participants;[32][33] ethereum blockchain; digix/digixdao;[34] and "the dao."[35][36][37][38] some of the largest token crowdsales in 2017 were tezos which raised us$232 million, bancor which raised us$153 million and status which raised us$102 million[39].     debt-based[edit]     see also: peer-to-peer lending     debt-based crowdfunding (also known as "peer to peer", "p2p", "marketplace lending", or "crowdlending") arose with the founding of zopa in the uk in 2005[40] and in the us in 2006, with the launches of lending club and prosper.com.[41] borrowers apply online, generally for free, and their application is reviewed and verified by an automated system, which also determines the borrower''s credit risk and interest rate. investors buy securities in a fund which makes the loans to individual borrowers or bundles of borrowers. investors make money from interest on the unsecured loans; the system operators make money by taking a percentage of the loan and a loan servicing fee.[41] in 2009, institutional investors entered the p2p lending arena; for example in 2013, google invested $125 million in lending club.[41] in 2014 in the us, p2p lending totalled about $5 billion.[42] in 2014 in the uk, p2p platforms lent businesses  749 million, a growth of 250% from 2012 to 2014, and lent retail customers  547 million, a growth of 108% from 2012 to 2014.[43]:23 in both countries in 2014, about 75% of all the money transferred through crowdfunding went through p2p platforms.[42] lending club went public in december 2014 at a valuation around $9 billion.[41] debt crowdfunding in the u.s. further evolved with the 2016 enactment of title iii of the jobs act, which allows unaccredited investors to invest directly in private businesses through regulated funding portals or broker-dealers.[44]     litigation[edit]     litigation crowdfunding allows plaintiffs or defendants to reach out to hundreds of their peers simultaneously in a semiprivate and confidential manner to obtain funding, either seeking donations or providing a reward in return for funding. it also allows investors to purchase a stake in a claim they have funded, which may allow them to get back more than their investment if the case succeeds (the reward is based on the compensation received by the litigant at the end of his or her case, known as a contingent fee in the united states, a success fee in the united kingdom, or a pactum de quota litis in many civil law systems).[45] lexshares is a platform that allows accredited investors to invest in lawsuits.[46]     donation-based[edit]     charity donation-based crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to help charitable causes.[47] in charity crowdfunding, funds are raised for pro-social or pro-environmental purposes.[48]     role[edit]     the inputs of the individuals in the crowd trigger the crowdfunding process and influence the ultimate value of the offerings or outcomes of the process. each individual acts as an agent of the offering, selecting and promoting the projects in which they believe. they sometimes play a donor role oriented towards providing help on social projects. in some cases, they become shareholders and contribute to the development and growth of the offering. individuals disseminate information about projects they support in their online communities, generating further support (promoters). motivation for consumer participation stems from the feeling of being at least partly responsible for the success of others  initiatives (desire for patronage), striving to be a part of a communal social initiative (desire for social participation), and seeking a payoff from monetary contributions (desire for investment).[5] additionally, individuals participate in crowdfunding to see new and innovative products before the public. early access often allows funders to participate more directly in the development of the product. crowdfunding is also particularly attractive to funders who are family and friends of a creator. it helps to mediate the terms of their financial agreement and manage each group s expectations for the project.[10]     an individual who takes part in crowdfunding initiatives tends to reveal several distinct traits: innovative orientation, which stimulates the desire to try new modes of interacting with firms and other consumers; social identification with the content, cause or project selected for funding, which sparks the desire to be a part of the initiative; (monetary) exploitation, which motivates the individual to participate by expecting a payoff.[5][49] crowdfunding platforms are motivated to generate income by drawing worthwhile projects and generous funders. these sites also seek widespread public attention for their projects and platform.[10]     crowdfunding websites helped companies and individuals worldwide raise us$89 million from members of the public in 2010, $1.47 billion in 2011, and $2.66 billion in 2012   $1.6 billion of the 2012 amount was raised in north america.[50] in 2012, more than one million individual campaigns were established globally[51] and the industry was projected to grow to us$5.1 billion in 2013.[51] and to reach us$1 trillion in 2025.[52] a may 2014 report, released by the united kingdom-based the crowdfunding centre and titled "the state of the crowdfunding nation", presented data showing that during march 2014, more than us$60,000 were raised on an hourly basis via global crowdfunding initiatives. also during this period, 442 crowdfunding campaigns were launched globally on a daily basis.[22]     platforms[edit]     further information: comparison of crowd funding services     in 2012, there were over 450 crowdfunding platforms operating.[53] in 2015 it was predicted that there would be over 2,000 crowdfunding sites to choose from in 2016.[54] project creators need to exercise their own due diligence to understand which platform is the best to use depending on the type of project that they want to launch.[49] fundamental differences exist in the services provided by many crowdfunding platforms.[5] for instance, crowdcube and seedrs are internet platforms which enable small companies to issue shares over the internet and receive small investments from registered users in return. while crowdcube is meant for users to invest small amounts and acquire shares directly in start-up companies, seedrs pools the funds to invest in new businesses, as a nominated agent.[55]     curated crowdfunding platforms serve as "network orchestrators" by curating the offerings that are allowed on the platform. they create the necessary organizational systems and conditions for resource integration among other players to take place.[5] relational mediators act as an intermediary between supply and demand. they replace traditional intermediaries (such as traditional record companies, venture capitalists). these platforms link new artists, designers, project initiators with committed supporters who believe in the persons behind the projects strongly enough to provide monetary support.[citation needed] growth engines focus on the strong inclusion of investors. they "disintermediate" by eliminating the activity of a service provider previously involved in the network. the platforms that use crowdfunding to seek stakes from a community of high net-worth private investors and match them directly with project initiators.[citation needed]     significant campaigns[edit]     early campaigns[edit]     the professional contractors group, a trade body representing freelancers in the uk, raised  100,000 over a two week period in 1999[56] from some 2000 freelancers threatened by a government measure known as ir35. in 2004, electric eel shock, a japanese rock band, raised  10,000 from 100 fans (the samurai 100) by offering them a lifetime membership on the band''s guestlist.[57] two years later, they became the fastest band to raise a us$50,000 budget on sellaband.[58] franny armstrong later created a donation system for her feature film the age of stupid.[59] over five years, from june 2004 to june 2009 (release date), she raised  1,500,000.[60] in december 2004, french entrepreneurs and producers benjamin pommeraud and guillaume colboc, launched a public internet donation campaign [61] to fund their short science fiction film, demain la veille (waiting for yesterday). within a month, they managed to raise  17,000 online, allowing them to shoot their film.[citation needed]     highest-grossing campaigns[edit]     as of 2015 the highest reported funding by a crowdfunded project to date was star citizen, an online space trading and combat video game being developed by chris roberts and cloud imperium games; it had raised $77m by that time, and while it had a devoted fan base it was also criticized for being a potential scam.[62]     brave s $35 million basic attention token (bat) sale sold out in less than 30 seconds.[63]     kickstarter campaigns[edit]     on april 17, 2014, the guardian media outlet published a list of "20 of the most significant projects" launched on the kickstarter platform prior to the date of publication:  musician amanda palmer raised us$1.2 million from 24,883 backers in june 2012 to make a new album and art book.[64]  the "coolest cooler" raised a total of $13,285,226 from 62,642 backers.[65] the cooler features a blender, waterproof bluetooth speakers and an led light.  zack brown raised $55,000 from over 6900 backers in september 2014 to make a bowl of potato salad. noteworthy is that his initial goal was only $10, but his campaign went viral and got a lot of attention. brown ended up throwing a potato salad party with over 3,000 pounds of potatoes.[66]     controversy[edit]                 amanda palmer (shown above) raised funds for her album using kickstarter.[64]  although musician palmer raised over $1 million through the kickstarter crowdfunding process, she received criticism afterward, some of which was published in prominent media outlets. writing for the new yorker, joshua clover initially focused upon issues specific to palmer, but then broadened the scope of his examination to include financial conduct in the internet era. ("you can t spell internet without intern.") according to clover, palmer initially invited local musicians to play on stage with her band and her on the stops of her u.s. tour, but offered to "feed you beer, hug/high-five you up and down (pick your poison), give you merch, and thank you mightily," instead of monetary compensation, as the money raised on kickstarter was allocated to the production of the next studio album in accordance with the campaign as well as other financial commitments.[67] this decision was then overturned a week later, as palmer explained on her blog:        my management team tweaked and reconfigured financials, pulling money from this and that other budget (mostly video) and moving it to the tour budget. all of the money we took out of those budgets is going to the crowd-sourced musicians fund. we are going to pay the volunteer musicians every night ... we''re also retroactively sending a payment to the folks who''ve already played with us.[67]     clover also made reference to the british political situation at the time, writing "that even newly minted haves, like amanda palmer, really need to treat have-nots, such as local musicians, a whole lot better." in a september 12, 2012 new york times article, american federation of musicians president raymond m. hair jr. explained, "if there''s a need for the musician to be on the stage, then there ought to be compensation for it."[68] the following day, prominent sound engineer and musician steve albini was also vocal and, after initially referring to palmer as an "idiot," apologized, writing that he had not met her or heard her music. following his apology, in which he admits "it''s my fault," albini asserted: "it should be obvious also that having gotten over a million dollars from such an effort that it is just plain rude to ask for further indulgences from your audience, like playing in your backing band for free."[69]     controversy arose in the crowdfunding sector in may 2014 when an adult entertainer was blocked by platform giveforward. following an allergy reaction, eden alexander required intensive medical treatment, but doctors, aware of her occupation, associated her health issue with drug use and did not provide the necessary care to a sufficient extent; as a consequence, alexander''s condition worsened. alexander then launched a giveforward crowdfunding campaign to cover her medical bills, but the campaign was removed from the platform after a social media exchange, whereby a potential donor requested nude pictures as reciprocation and alexander agreed to the offer this was noticed within a brief time frame and wepay, the payment service used by giveforward, deemed the negotiation a violation of wepay''s terms of service, considering it the offer of "adult or adult-related services ... adult or adult-related content ... and obscene or pornographic items." alexander restarted her crowdfunding campaign by using the services of tilt.com. the campaign ended on june 13, 2014 with $10,550 raised.[70]     following the alexander incident of may 2014, wepay ceo bill clerico wrote an explanation of their terms in relation to adult services to the techcrunch media outlet:        wepay faces tremendous scrutiny from its partners &amp; card networks around the enforcement of policy, especially when it comes to adult content. we must enforce these policies or we face hefty fines or the risk of shutdown for the many hundreds of thousands of merchants on our service. we re incredibly sorry that these policies added to the difficulties that eden is facing. we offered to help her setup a new campaign that complied with our policies, but i believe that her friends chose to work with another company instead. we continue to stand by to help if eden would like to work with us further, and we are reviewing both our terms of service &amp; account shutdown process to see how we can avoid situations like this in the future.[70]     clerico further stated that such practice is "a relatively common requirement in the industry" and assured the techcrunch writer that wepay agreed to cease alexander''s campaign "because we are contractually required to."[70]     applications[edit]     crowdfunding is being explored as a potential funding mechanism for creative work such as blogging and journalism,[71] music, independent film (see crowdfunded film),[72][73] and for funding startup companies.[74][75][76][77] community music labels are usually for-profit organizations where "fans assume the traditional financier role of a record label for artists they believe in by funding the recording process".[78] since pioneering crowdfunding in the film industry, spanner films has published a "how to" guide.[79] a financialist article published in mid-september 2013 stated that "the niche for crowdfunding exists in financing films with budgets in the [us]$1 to $10 million range" and crowdfunding campaigns are "much more likely to be successful if they tap into a significant pre-existing fan base and fulfill an existing gap in the market."[80] innovative new platforms, such as rockethub, have emerged that combine traditional funding for creative work with branded crowdsourcing helping artists and entrepreneurs unite with brands "without the need for a middle man."[81]     food and agriculture[edit]     several crowdfunding platforms have emerged that allow people to donate or invest in food- and agriculture-related opportunities. agfunder is one global platform that gives both individual and institutional investors access to venture capital investments, both in agriculture technology and food technology companies.[82] cropital has developed a platform to allow investors to invest in small-holder farmers,[83] and rewards-based platforms like barnraiser allow users to support farmers and food startups.[84]     the crowdfunding platform pieshell was launched in 2016 to focus exclusively on food and beverage campaigns.[85]     philanthropy and civic projects[edit]     a variety of crowdfunding platforms have emerged to allow ordinary web users to support specific philanthropic projects without the need for large amounts of money.[25] globalgiving allows individuals to browse through a selection of small projects proposed by nonprofit organizations worldwide, donating funds to projects of their choice. microcredit crowdfunding platforms such as kiva (organization) facilitate crowdfunding of loans managed by microcredit organizations in developing countries. the us-based nonprofit zidisha applies a direct person-to-person lending model to microcredit lending for low-income small business owners in developing countries.[86]     donorschoose.org, founded in 2000, allows public school teachers in the united states to request materials for their classrooms. individuals can lend money to teacher-proposed projects, and the organization fulfills and delivers supplies to schools. there are also a number of own-branded university crowdfunding websites, which enable students and staff to create projects and receive funding from alumni of the university or the general public. several dedicated civic crowdfunding platforms have emerged in the us and the uk, some of which have led to the first direct involvement of governments in crowdfunding. in the uk, spacehive is used by the mayor of london and manchester city council to co-fund civic projects created by citizens.[87] similarly, dedicated humanitarian crowdfunding initiatives are emerging, involving humanitarian organizations, volunteers and supports in solving and modeling how to build innovative crowdfunding solutions for the humanitarian community. likewise, international organizations like the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (ocha) have been researching and publishing about the topic.[88]     one crowdfunding project, icancer, was used to support a phase 1 trial of advince an anti-cancer drug in 2016.[89][90]     real estate[edit]     real estate crowdfunding is the online pooling of capital from investors to fund mortgages sec','original',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

    (3611,'cursor on web page','               hi   margaret,                 just to add to   the tips sieghard &amp; others have given, below is from the jaws help   files:         placemarkers    a placemarker is a bookmark that you can easily add to a web page, html, pdf,   or word document, or form to mark a location. this is useful when you want to   return to commonly used areas on a web page, important sections or paragraphs of   an html document, or specific parts, such as required fields, of a complicated   form. placemarkers can be defined as temporary or permanent and can be anchored   to text, elements of the current web page, or to a web site''s domain. multiple   placemarkers can be added to html or pdf documents, while only one can be added   to a word document.     the following describes how to add, rename, or delete placemarkers. if you   are not familiar with placemarkers and need more information, refer to  important   placemarker concepts . for additional placemarker operation, refer to  advanced   placemarker usage . for general information about using placemarkers in a   word document, refer to  marking   and returning to a placemarker in word .    adding a temporary placemarker    to quickly add a temporary placemarker, do the following:       open a web page, other html document, or word document.       move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put     the placemarker.       press  ctrl+windows key+k . a temporary placemarker now     appears on the page.     you can always jump to it using any of the     following  navigation     quick keys :  k ,  shift+k ,      shift+  number row keys  7  through      0 , or  ctrl+shift+k . (the last keystroke     opens the placemarker list. select temporary from the list, and then choose     the move to button.)      selecting between the temporary placemarker and the cursor position    to select text between a temporary placemarker and your current position in a   web page, html document, or word document, do the following:       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to set a temporary placemarker.       navigate to another location on the web page or document, then press      insert+spacebar, m . all text between the temporary     placemarker and your current cursor position is selected and ready to be     copied to the clipboard.      this method is often easier than using the  shift key  in   conjunction with the  arrow  keys when attempting to select large   blocks of text.    adding permanent placemarkers to web pages or html documents    to add a placemarker, do the following:       open a web page or other html document.       move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put     the placemarker.       press  ctrl+shift+k  and then  enter .       the add placemarker dialog box opens with focus in the name edit field. it     contains text that appears at the cursor location. if you want to change the     placemarker name, type a new name in this field; otherwise, press      tab  to move to the next control.       the define for all pages on current domain check box is cleared by     default, which allows the placemarker to be anchored only to the current web     page or html document. if you want to use this placemarker so that it is     anchored to all pages within the current domain instead, press      spacebar  to select the check box. press  tab      to move to the next control.       the anchor to text check box is cleared by default. select this check box     if you want to link the placemarker with specific text, such as a heading,     that appears on the page. this can be useful on frequently updated web pages     where text and elements tend to drift from their original position. when     selected, the next control, anchor text edit field, automatically populates     using the original text in the name edit field. this guarantees that the     placemarker will always be associated with this text on the web page.       press  tab  to navigate to the ok button and press      spacebar  to close the dialog box and save the placemarker.          renaming placemarkers    to change the name of a placemarker, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to rename.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of placemarkers on     this page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select the placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the change name button or press      alt+c .       enter a new name for the placemarker and then press  spacebar      on the ok button.      removing placemarkers    to remove one or more placemarkers, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to delete.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of all placemarkers     on the current page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select a placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the remove button or press      alt+r  to delete the placemarker.       tip:  if you want to delete all placemarkers   for this page, press  spacebar  on the remove all button or press    alt+l .    important placemarker concepts    the following sections, placemarker keystrokes, temporary versus permanent   placemarkers, and url versus domain placemarkers, are key to understanding   placemarkers with jaws.    placemarker keystrokes for web pages, html documents, or forms       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to insert a temporary     placemarker.       press  insert+spacebar, m  to select text between the     temporary placemarker and your current cursor position.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to open the placemarker list dialog     box to add a new placemarker, rename or change existing placemarker     parameters, jump to placemarkers, or delete placemarkers.         press  k  to jump to the next placemarker.       press  shift+k  to jump to the previous placemarker.       press number row keys  7  through  0  to     hear the content of placemarkers 1 through 4.       press  shift+  number row keys  7  through      0  to jump to placemarkers 1 through 4.       press  alt+windows key+k  to speak all of the placemarkers     on a web page or in an html document.      placemarker keystrokes for word documents       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to set a placemarker at the     current cursor position. only one placemarker can be set per word document.       press  alt+windows key+k  to return to the marker in a word     document.       press  insert+spacebar, m  to select text or items from the     marker to the current cursor position.      temporary versus permanent placemarkers    you can add a temporary placemarker anywhere on a web page by pressing    ctrl+windows key+k . this lets you easily mark a spot that you   can return to later by pressing  k . only one temporary   placemarker may be set per web page. if you later decide to move the temporary   placemarker to a different place on the web page, just move the virtual cursor   to that new location and press  ctrl+windows key+k  again.    if you want to make the temporary placemarker permanent, press    ctrl+shift+k  to open the placemarker list dialog box and add it   to the list, which lets you keep and maintain multiple placemarkers on the web   page, html document, or form. the last location where you set a temporary   placemarker is saved until you move it again, or remove the placemarker from the   placemarkers list dialog. you can browse to other web pages, exit jaws, even   restart your computer, and your temporary and permanent placemarkers are   preserved.    url versus domain placemarkers    jaws lets you assign placemarkers to either the current web address (the url   displayed in the address bar) or domain (the overall web site name). the url   (uniform resource locator) is the web address displayed in the address bar. you   can only use placemarkers assigned to the current url when you are visiting that   page.     individual web pages are contained within a domain. the domain''s name is   usually the first portion of the page''s web address and ends with .com, .net,   .org, .gov, .edu, or similar suffix. when you add a domain placemarker to a web   page, you can use that placemarker on any page within the current domain. since   many sites use a consistent design for all of their pages, the placement of   links, graphics, buttons, and form fields is often similar. if this is the case,   you can use a single domain placemarker to navigate many other pages on the   site.     for example, if a web site has a search box located at the top of each page,   you can put a domain placemarker there named "search." you can then use this   placemarker to move to the search box on any page in the domain, regardless of   the url.    advanced placemarker usage    the following describes other ways to customize and display placemarkers.       sharing placemarkers    you can use settings packager to share your placemarkers for a web site with   other jaws users. settings packager is a program that lets you save speech and   sound schemes, placemarkers, and personalized web settings in a compressed .zip   file that you can send in an e-mail message, post on a web site, or copy to   removable storage media. you can also use settings packager to import the   settings contained in these .zip files into jaws. to start settings packager,   press  insert+f2 , select "settings packager," and press    enter . for more information on using this program, open the   settings packager help menu and choose help topics.    to share your placemarkers with other jaws users without using settings   packager:        open your jaws user settings folder from the start menu, all programs,     jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws, explore my     settings.       move to the placemarkers folder and press  enter .       placemarker information is stored in .pmi files. locate the .pmi file with     the same name as the page containing the placemarkers you want to share.       copy this file and distribute it to other users. these users then need to     copy the .pmi file on their placemarkers folder by going to the start menu,     all programs, jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws,     explore my settings and open the placemarkers folder. the users can now     navigate that html page with your placemarkers.      custom page summary    when you open an html page, the custom page summary feature automatically   lists each placemarker on the page and its associated text. this lets you   quickly review the text located near your placemarkers so you can hear any   changes or updates to those areas of the page. to enable or disable this   feature, do the following:       open settings center ( insert+f2 ) or quick settings     ( insert+v ).       in the search edit box, type "placemarker" without the quotes.       press  down arrow  to move to custom placemarker page     summary in the filtered results of the tree view. (note that for web browsers,     this option appears in both the virtual cursor options group and the     personalized web settings group.)       press  spacebar  to toggle through the following settings.             select "speak placemarkers on page load" to have jaws read the name of     each placemarker on the current page as well as the text that appears near the     placemarker''s location.       select "list placemarkers in results viewer on page load" to have jaws     display the placemarker information for the page in the results viewer. the     results viewer provides a link with the name of the placemarker and the text     that appears near the placemarker''s location on the page. you can use the      arrow  keys to move to a link and then press      enter  to move to that placemarker.       select "do nothing" to have jaws provide a custom page summary.         take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my   ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license   agreement.  in the end you have to ignore everything, &amp; click i   agree.

    (3614,'cursors in jaws',' in recent versions of jaws there is also the touch cursor (i believe  this to be a poor name, something better would have been "object  cursor"). the touch cursor allows navigating between screen elements  in a hierarchical manner as the program organizes them, and has two  modes normal and advanced. the advanced mode allows for navigating  through elements that cannot themselves gain focus (or necessarily  even appear as distinct items - invisible frames for example).    the benefit of this cursor mode over the jaws cursor is that you can  reach elements that the jaws cursor does not show. it it takes some  work on the part of program developers but if programs are written in  an accessible manner the touch cursor takes care of this issue.  and  it is becoming more of an issue as time goes by because the jaws  cursor can not see screen elements drawn using the newer directx  rendering path only those drawn with the older gdi technology.    to activate the touch cursor use shoft+numpad+ (numpad + twice quickly  to disable). i pretty much only use the advanced mode (toggled with  the numpad* key). in that mode you use the left and right arrow keys  to move between elements at the current level and the up and down  arrows to move up and down the object tree. space will trigger the  default action on the current element.    i am sure there are other things you can do while in the touch cursor  mode but those are the only ones i use.

    (3632,'custom labels','          good morning folks     i have never used the custom lables feature of jaws but have a webpage where it maybe useful for me.     so to give you background i am the financial secretary for a local chapter of an organization with nearly 1000 members where i collect annual dues we have an online billing nd recording  website which is semi accessible . where i would record dues there are edit boxes to enter amount of payment and check number that are not labeled. i have memorized how to navigate the page however every once in a while i post to the wrong account as i type faster than my brain keeps up. the names are in a table and the paid amount edit boxes are in a column in said table and the same to record the check number. so my 2 questions are as follows. first if i put a custom label in the top edit box of the column is there a way to replicate it down that column? second once dues are paid the names come off the list for the year does anyone know if the labels will hold when i bill out for next year? just trying to determine if this is worth the effort or just stick with what i am doing.     thanks  joe                     virus-free.   www.avast.com                 ','original',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
