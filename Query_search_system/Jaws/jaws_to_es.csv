382,ability to read pictures or screen shots?,"hi jim,           here's the information from jaws  help:           convenient ocr  frequently, you will encounter  images that contain textual information.  these can include a pdf file, the  setup screen of an application, or the  menu of selections for a dvd movie.  while these images contain text that is  readable by a sighted person, jaws is  unable to read the text as it is part  of the image.           the convenient ocr (optical character recognition)  feature enables you to  access any image on the screen that includes text, or  recognize all of the  text in a pdf document. with just a few simple  keystrokes, jaws will  recognize the image in a matter of seconds and activate  the jaws cursor so  you can navigate the resulting text. the recognized text  will be in the same  location as the actual image on the screen. in order to  differentiate the  recognized text from other text that may be in the window,  jaws will use a  different voice when it encounters the recognized text. when  you activate  the pc cursor, or switch to another application or dialog box,  the text is  removed and you will need to perform the ocr again.         if you open a pdf document and there is no text  available to read, you can  perform a keystroke that will recognize the entire  document and place the  resulting text into the results viewer for reading.  you can then use  standard reading commands to review the text or select and  copy sections of  content for pasting in other applications.         to use convenient ocr, the following layered  keystrokes are available:         insert+spacebar, o, d. recognizes the currently  open pdf document.  insert+spacebar, o, w. recognizes the current application  window that has  focus.  insert+spacebar, o, s. recognizes the entire  screen.  insert+spacebar, o, c. recognizes the currently selected control,  such as a  graphical button.  insert+spacebar, o, q. cancels recognition  while it is in progress.  insert+spacebar, o, question mark. speaks a brief  help message describing  the commands in the ocr layer.  the following  examples illustrate just some of the uses of this feature.         you insert a dvd movie into your computer which  brings up a menu allowing  you to select from various dvd features. you press  insert+spacebar, o, w and  after a few seconds, jaws will alert you that ocr  is complete. at this  point, the jaws cursor will be active and you can  navigate around the screen  using the arrow keys and read the text of the  menu. when you hear the option  you want, press numpad slash to perform a  left-mouse-click, or insert+numpad  plus to route pc to jaws to activate the  option. prior to jaws 13, this menu  would have been completely  inaccessible.  note: depending on the type of screen the dvd displays and the  quality of  the text, the convenient ocr may not always work. some dvd screens  will be  recognized better than others.         you open a pdf in adobe reader which turns out to  be inaccessible. press  insert+spacebar, o, d to have jaws begin recognizing  the entire document.  after several seconds, the contents of the pdf file are  displayed in the  results viewer for reading. use standard reading commands to  review the text  or select and copy sections of content for pasting in other  applications.  for example, you could select all, then copy and paste into a  microsoft word  document, which you could then save.  note: the ocr process  takes longer for larger pdf files. as text is  recognized, it is added to the  end of the existing text already in the  results viewer. this allows you to  continue reading without interruption as  the document is processed. if you  are currently not reading using say all,  jaws announces the current line as  new text is added to the results viewer  to indicate that ocr is still in  progress.         note: if the pdf document requires a password, you  will be prompted to enter  it when you first press insert+spacebar, o, d. you  must enter the correct  password before the ocr process will  continue.         you try to install or use an application whose  interface is not accessible,  such as acronisr true imaget home 2011 or 2012.  if no text is readily  available when pressing tab or when using the jaws  cursor, you can try  convenient ocr. start with the pc cursor and press  insert+spacebar, o, w to  recognize the text of the welcome screen graphic.  you can then use the jaws  cursor and numpad slash (left mouse button) to move  to and choose what are  possible buttons and links.  if you are not getting  clear recognition results or you find that text is  running together when you  recognize the current screen, window, or control,  refer to faq 63556 for ways  to optimize performance. when recognizing a pdf  document, convenient ocr does  not use the physical image that is currently  visible on the screen, so the  recognition results feature a higher degree of  accuracy since they are not  affected by the current screen resolution.         note that to correctly recognize text in other  languages, you can configure  the primary and secondary ocr language. the  convenient ocr settings are in  the main tree view in settings center. when  you expand this item, you have  primary recognition language and secondary  recognition language settings.  use the spacebar to cycle through the  available languages until you hear the  one you want, or press f6 to move to  the combo box and select a language.         when you install jaws from the program disc, the  ocr components are  automatically installed. if you download jaws from the web  site and have an  active internet connection when you begin the installation,  the ocr  components will be downloaded during the install. if you do not have  an  active internet connection when you install jaws from the web download,  a  message is displayed at the end of the installation stating that  some  components were not installed. to use the ocr feature, establish an  internet  connection and run the installation again so the ocr components  are  downloaded.              take care.  mike  global warming?  most likely caused from hot air  generated by politicians!",Answer

506,accessible media players,"well, after pressing the enter key on an mp3 file, for instance, winamp   should start playing the file. assuming that it does, pressing:    c pauses/unpauses playback,  x plays the file from the beginning,  v stops playback,  shift+v stops but with a fade,  left arrow rewinds playback,  right arrow key fast forwards playback,    these are some basic keystrokes. other winamp users will hopefully chime   in with more keystrokes and other info to share. if you should have   problems using winamp or discuss any issues using winamp, ask your   question and include any messages if there are any.",Answer

508,accessible media players,"also, before or playing a file, pressing r toggles the repeat feature on   or off.    when playing a file and the sound sounds like it's coming out of one   speaker more than the other, you'd need to reset the balance to 0 which   effectively balances  the sound to come out of both speakers. so   pressing control+alt+k sets the balance to 0%, control+alt+j (50%) or h   (100%) sets the balance to the left speaker, and control+alt+l (50%) or   semicolon (100%) sets the balance to the right speaker.    while a file is playing, press control+j to jump to a specified time to   play. specify the amount of minutes followed by a colon and the number   of seconds you want to start playback from. there is no specifying of   hours, so if the time you want to jump to is 2 hours and zero seconds,   you'd type 120:00 and press enter.    and if you want winamp to jump to a different time, jumping to a sertain   time always starts from the beginning, effectivly 0 minutes and 0   seconds. so if you decide you want to listen 10 minutes into the file,   you'd type 10:00. but if what you want actually starts 20 minutes   instead of 10 minutes into the file, you'd type 20:00.    you can also have a bunch of audio files in a folder and have winamp   play those files without creating a playlist. select all of the files   you want and press enter.    if you play a playlist, pressing b advances playback to the next track   and z moves and plays the prior track within the playlist (m3u, pls or   asx files).    there's alot you can do with winamp. these are just some i heard of but   don't use regularly.",Answer

534,accessible password managers,"password safe doesn't automatically fill in login forms but it does allow you to very easily copy either your username or password (but not both at once) to the clipboard.  if you include the url for the website for which a given username/password applies there's also a built in ""browse to url"" function or you can use the ""go"" button in the password entry creation/editing dialog to have it fire up in your default browser.  have a look at  http://www.howtoanswer.com/manage-and-store-multiple-passwords-with-password-safe--148.html   this page is accessible even though it's screen shot intensive.  the narrative does a pretty good job of describing what's being done at various steps as far as creating entries, etc.  also, as an aside, what i call the portmanteau method of creating passwords is a way to create complex passwords that are easy for you to remember and horribly difficult for other people to guess.  what you do is construct a ""standard password"" out of parts that are significant to you, combined with something that's simple to remember about your website, that will differ based on where you're using it.  password length is something that adds a lot to password strength, so the longer the better so long as it doesn't become a pain to enter (unless you're using something like password safe to store and copy/paste them, then you can go crazy, but i still generally key mine in by hand so i use portmanteaus that are easy to remember.  let's say your childhood home was located at 1523 betsy bell drive.  your favorite pet was your cat, fuzz.  your grandmother's given name was nancy.  your preferred special character is an asterisk.  for a given website you could create the portmanteau:  nancyfuzz&lt;site specific something here&gt;1523*.  when you already know the nancyfuzz is at the front and the 1523* is at the end it becomes very easy to get passwords like nancyfuzzgmail1523*, nancyfuzzmybank1523*.  you can use phrases that no one else would know instead of constructions like this, e.g., hastemakeswastegmail1523*.  it's a matter of coming up with something that's very easy for you to remember as far as the general construction rule, but that would be virtually impossible for a random person who isn't you to guess.  it's amazing how quickly one becomes at typing the ""repeated parts"" of even long portmanteau passwords.  it also allows you to create something that's distinct to virtually any purpose without any two of them being exactly the same.  --       brian                  a great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.           ~    saul bellow   ,  to jerusalem and back",Answer

794,adding favorites in firefox,"no, i don t think there is a way to accomplish this.  the favorites  list is connected to ie, and the bookmarks list is connected to firefox.   there is no way to add items to the ie favorites list from firefox, nor any way  to add items to the ff bookmarks list from ie.  plain old favorites was  really designed for ie users who want the ability to access the favorites list  from firefox as theirsecondary browser.  i use ie 11 as my primary browser  and only use firefox with webvisum to solve image captchas, although now that i  have signed up with rumola and can solve image captchas with ie, i will probably  use firefox even less frequently.                     gerald",Answer

810,adding favorites in firefox,"the difference is that if you know how to do it, you can make a shortcut to your favorites folder, and without having to open your browser first, you can click on a favorite and go directly there. with a bookmark, you can't do that, because there is no way to get to your bookmarks without opening the browser first. this way, it's like being able to open a favorite, and every favorite becomes a temporary home page in the browser.  bill white billwhite92701@...",Answer

832,adding voices,"i'm so glad this seems counterintuitive to you.  this comes up periodically on this list.  i think i'm the last to have encountered this problem.  there were lots of good suggestions, but none worked.  technical support at freedom scientific walked me through the following.  i'm guessing you are talking about the vocalizer expressive 2 voices.  they actually don't show up anywhere one would expect.  go to the jaws menu (jawskey + j), then activate the ""options.""  after that, go to the voice adjustment menu.  you will see some software synthesizers, including eloquence.  you will have a vocalizer expressive voice installed.  you probably already had one installed.  so, it looks like nothing happened.  well, that may be true, but it probably is just the counterintuitive way freedom scientific set this up.  i'm guessing you are looking for susan, allison, or one of the other voice persons. they are there; they are just hidden.  arrow down to the vocalizer expressive synthesizer.  then press alt + v.  you might have to tab once (i don't remember specifically, but you are not more than two tabs away after you hit alt + v).    i think you can now arrow up and down to pick your voice, e.g., susan or alison.  arrow down to pick the voice you want to use (at least part of the time).  then, do the most important thing of all!  tab over, way over, until you come to a ""save as"" prompt.  at that point save this ""person"" as a synthesizer, e.g., susanvoice or alisonvoice.  then hit apply and ok.  now, when you do a voice adjustment, you will have synthesizers that match the name and settings for the ""persons, e.g., susanvoice.""  by the way, you do this process even if you downloaded the big files individually.  remember, the compressed voices all come in one file.  i'm guessing you downloaded the big files that are linked to the ""person"" names.  that, in fact, is what fooled me.  i downloaded susan, and i illogically thought i would find a file installed as susan.  not so.  all the voices are tucked away in the vocalizer expressive menu.",Answer

843,adding voices,"in theory, i agree that there is some logic to the idea of selecting the synthesizer first and then the person, and if i (and the several people  who have been stumped by this two-step process) had simply downloaded the compact voices for the vocalizer synthesizer in a single file, none of us would expect to find anything besides  vocalizer  in the list of synthesizers.  so, i agree with you up to this  point.        the problem arises when a separate file is required for each of the  high premium  voices.  one must separately download files for susan, allison,  and so on.       then, when one goes to look for those files, they don t exist.  all that exists is  vocalizer,  which one might assume (and several have assumed)  related to the old vocalizer 1 synthesizer for jaws 17 and before.  that susan, allison, and the others were separately downloaded suggested that, perhaps, they were, in effect, separate synthesizers.  nowhere in any documentation are we told that, though  these voices are downloaded as separate files, they are, in fact, really only parts of the same vocalizer synthesizer.          it is the process of seemingly hiding the separately downloaded files that threw me off, and i think several others have been flummoxed by the same  thing).",Answer

928,advanced searching in outlook 2010 - opinions sought,"i generally prefer to teach keystrokes to access the required ribbon options to accomplish something, but this time i might make an exception.  once you're in an outlook folder you wish to search it's a simple matter to hit ctrl+e to be thrown into the search box.  after that things become much more complicated.  if you want to search on the from field, the keystroke sequence to do this is alt+js+om, then one types in the partial or full name or e-mail address one wishes to search on.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""from,"" open parenthesis, the partial or full name or e-mail address, and a close parenthesis directly in the search box to accomplish precisely the same thing.  if you want to get only messages that have attachments, the keystroke sequence to do this is alt+js+h, and that creates a search only for messages that have attachments.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""hasattachments:"" followed immediately by either ""yes"" or ""no"" and can filter for messages that either do or do not have attachments directly into the search box.  if you want to filter by date, the keystroke sequence is alt+js+w, this brings up a drop down menu from which you can choose today, yesterday, this week, last week, this month, last month, this year, or last year.  by contrast, one can enter the search operator ""received:"" followed by one of the previously listed single words or two-word phrases.  all of the above can, of course, be combined together.  there are also additional criteria that can be specified but i'm trying to focus on the most common and useful.  let's say i'm trying to find an e-mail that i sent to you, last week, that has an attachment on it.  i can do one of two things after hitting ctrl+e:  1.  immediately type ""from(brian vogel) received:last week hasattachments:yes"" in the search box by hand.  2.  hit alt+js+om and immediately type ""brian vogel,"" then hit alt+js+w and use down arrow to go through the dropdown to find last week, then hit alt+js+h  the second option is, to me, much more cumbersome than the first, once you know what the search operator terms and formats are.  in addition, it is only through hand entering ""hasattachments:no"" that one can limit the search to messages that do not have an attachment, no keystroke sequence generates the ""no"" condition.  i'm sure that some of you have had to use advanced searching to filter out as much extraneous e-mail in your archives as you possibly can before trying to locate a specific message from the returned results.  what say you regarding whether it makes more sense in this case to focus on the search operators that you type yourself versus the keystrokes and typing involved to do each via the ribbon?  brian",Help

1072,an alternative to pitch change to indicate capitalization,"sometimes when i m distracted (i like to think of that as multitasking), i don t always catch a pitch change to  indicate a capital letter.  often, that s just fine.       in a complex agreement with 25 or 30 precisely defined terms, terms that, when used in the specifically defined  sense, are capitalized, close enough won t work.       whether a term is or is not capitalized can be crucial, and an error can cost a client thousands of dollars.       for those on the list new to jaws who similarly must be certain when a word is capitalized (or in bold or italics),  therefore, it might be helpful to know that jaws has a wonderful proofreading tool called  sound scheme.        these  schemes  may be reached with jawskey + alt + s.  an array of previously defined schemes are available, and  you can modify or add your own.  there are two proofreading schemes that i use frequently and they are named fittingly,  proof reading.  .       instead of changing pitch, they say  cap.   pitch changes are used to indicate bold, italics, underlining and so  on.       window-eyes allowed one fairly easily to change capitalization indication in settings, something that is a challenge  in jaws, but i don t think window-eyes had the equivalent of these sound schemes (though my window-eyes knowledge is about 7 years old), which can be invoked with just about 3 keystrokes.       happy proofing. &lt;smile&gt;                                   from:       main@jfw.groups.io [mailto:main@jfw.groups.io]   on behalf of   carol smith via groups.io     sent:   tuesday, may 23, 2017 9:13 am     to:   main@jfw.groups.io     subject:   re: voices and pitch                    believe me, i did not figure this out on my own, grin.  i had lots of helpful information from others on the group.  just trying  to pay it forward a little, grin.             i like samantha compact with my own pitch level.  she reminds me of my ipod now.          carol                 on 5/23/2017 8:59 am, lisle, ted (chfs dms) wrote:             carol, guess you just contradicted what i said  in another post, and thank you.  i use vocalizer  now and again, and will bare that in mind.               ted                    from:     main@jfw.groups.io  [ mailto:main@jfw.groups.io ]   on behalf of   carol smith via groups.io     sent:   monday, may 22, 2017 8:26 pm     to:     main@jfw.groups.io      subject:   re: voices and pitch                  thanks mike,             with the instructions you provided plus the clarification from sieghard, excuse me if i didn't spell it correctly, i was able to make the pitch changes.  yes, you can change pitch for other  synthes, too.  i am using the vocalizer compact voices and they work quite well with the pitch changes.              thanks again, and take care.            carol                        on 5/22/2017 6:25 pm, mike b. wrote:             hi carol,                       the steps i provided are for eloquence.  i don't use any other voices, so i'm sorry i didn't mention  that.  now with that being said, if you follow the steps, &amp; when you tab to, voice adjust / all contexts, arrow down to, pc, jaws, keyboard, or tutor &amp; message cursor options, tab through each of these, &amp; you will find the voice pitch slider.  if you make  a change in 1 of these cursors, tab to apply, &amp; spacebar it to save the change for that cursor.  after you make changes to each cursor apply them, &amp; when you are working with the last cursor after applying your change, now tab to okay &amp; press enter to save  all your changes &amp; close.           take care, mike.   sennt from my ibarstool.  go dodgers!

1205,any good audio editors that work with jaws?,"yes, there are several.  goldwave is a shareware program that can do editing for mono or stereo  settings. the big dog in that arena is sound forge, and up to version 8 it's  probably the most accessible audio editor you can find, no scripts needed.  but it isn't shareware. (it's what i use for professional quality editing  and mastering)  nothing else even comes close to the options you can do  completely from the keyboard with this program, because it was developed by  the guys who created the first multimedia code for windows back in the  windows 3.1 days.  for multitrack editors bryan has already mentioned audacity, which does a  good job with accessibility out of the box. reaper is also an option, with  scripts for both jaws and nvda and a huge number of folks who support it.  audacity is just an audio editor, while reaper is a full functioned daw  (digital audio workstation) application.  on the pay side cakewalk's program sonar used to be a good option, but  scripts for it have stalled thanks to their recent releases changing so  much, so it might be a contender again but right now i have a hard time  recommending it, as the version with scripts is several revisions back. more  will be developing on this front soon, as other daw environments are getting  some accessibility attention.",Answer

1210,any good audio editors that work with jaws?,"for sound forge you're going to want to pick it up from any music retailer like www.sweetwater.com or just about anywhere else. you'll want to downgrade to sound forge 8 for the best accessibility experience. be forewarned -- this kind of quality comes with a price tag, unless you're running an os that can run some of the older sound forge le versions.  i don't have the url for reaper handy, but a web search should turn it up in the first few links -- ixquick has the download site in the first two.",Answer
1211,any good audio editors that work with jaws?,"though reaper has an advertised 60 day trial period, those who aren't worried about the ethics of using shareware for longer than the trial period will find that it doesn't disable any functions when the trial ends, so it's not crippleware. i do suggest paying it, as it's a responsive environment and the programmers of it are worth the money. it's also probably the least expensive accessible option for us that has this level of functionality.

1212,any good audio editors that work with jaws?,"nicole,           i agree regarding reaper and paying.  a $60 individual license, that even allows limited commercial use, and a $225 full commercial license for someone doing constant commercial-grade work is an absolute steal.           that being said, and given the original request that spawned this thread, i had a little chuckle at ""it's limited to 16 tracks . . .!""  sixteen tracks might be limited to someone such as yourself, but for most people looking for a sound editor that goes beyond bare basics, but don't need full professional, sixteen tracks is overkill times somewhere in the range of thirteen to fifteen!!  even more so if you install the add-ins that allow audacity to do mp3 conversion and a myriad other filters,etc.  brian",Answer

1743,best accessible update software for windows 10,"the honest-to-god answer to that question, regardless of your version of windows, is  none .  as a repair technician with some years experience i can tell you that there are only two locations from which you should ever obtain driver updates for your computer, in this order:   the support page of your computer's manufacturer for the specific model you have.  if nothing is available at number one, then the support page of the manufacturer of a specific component or peripheral that you know is installed or that you have installed yourself.   driver updater software is one of the primary causes of all sorts of computer chaos, including spyware, malware, and viruses.  most major manufacturers now include a ""background support assistant"" of some sort that actually constantly checks to see if they've released any driver updates and that will either download and install them automatically or notify you that they're available and to download them manually.  those, unlike third party driver updaters, can be trusted.  brian",Answer

1745,best free accessible pc tuners for windows 10,"probably not what you wanted to hear, but my opinion on any of the so-called tune up applications for pc s is very low, i think they mostly are garbage and while they claim they do whatever it is they do i wonder what  they really do. i used to have a registry cleaner and the interesting part was that when you ran it it came up with whatever number of items it said it needed to clean up, so you told it to go ahead and clean them up. afterwards if i ran it again it again  said it had so many items to clean up so i told i t to do it again and it just kept on going. i feel that if it says it needs to clean up 23 items then once that is done it s done for a while and it shouldn t have another 20 items 5 seconds later.     my advice is to make sure your windows is updated, run disc cleanup from time to time and if you can just don t install a bunch of junk you later on end up uninstalling again. windows has been  getting better at managing things as well so with windows 10 i personally feel there is no reason why one should have to run these tune up applications, but as i said, that is just my opinion.              regards,       sieghard",Answer

 moving by headings, paragraphs, forms, tables, lists,   graphics, and regions,   are available. more navigation quick keys will be   supported in future   updates.         by default, jaws uses semi-auto forms mode in edge, which turns on forms     mode automatically only when you move to a form control using tab or     shift+tab.  due to the way edge displays pages, auto forms mode is not   available as it   is possible to have multiple controls on a single line. you   will need to   press  enter to turn on forms mode if you use the arrow keys   to move to form   fields.         other familiar jaws features that are currently supported include:         list of 4 items  . displaying a list of links, headings, or form controls   by pressing   insert+f7, insert+f6, or insert+f5.  . searching for text on   the current page by pressing ctrl+f.  . obtaining font information by pressing   insert+f.  . the ability for jaws to detect changes in the language used on a   web page   and automatically switch to the appropriate voice if   available.  list end         as you begin using edge, one important item to note is that edge is a   modern   app with no menu bar that can be accessed using the alt key. to   access edge  specific features, press tab from the bottom of a page or   shift+tab from the   top. continue using tab or shift+tab to move through the   various controls  until you cycle back around to the content area.   alternatively, edge offers   many of the same shortcut keys found in other   browsers such as ctrl+t to   open  a new tab, ctrl+h for history, ctrl+i for   favorites, ctrl+j for downloads,   and so on.         other changes  list of 16 items  . resolved stability issues reported   by multiple customers using jaws with   outlook 365.  . addressed a reported   issue with audacity, a popular sound editor, where   the application would   stop working when attempting to open an mp3 file with   jaws  currently   running.  . this update contains changes necessary to support firefox version   57,   scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2017. firefox users must     update  to jaws 18.0.4321 to continue using this browser when it updates   to version   57.  . added the latest brailliant bi display drivers from   humanware to support   their brailliant bi14 braille display.  . resolved a   customer reported issue with the ups tracking research it   lookup source not   displaying any results.  . in internet explorer, addressed a customer reported   issue with jaws not   always reading the correct label on form controls when   navigating using tab.  . resolved an issue where jaws was not correctly   loading settings for office   applications when office 365 was installed   through the windows store.  . addressed an issue with jaws not reading the   contents of a book in the   kindle for pc app.  . in the latest version of   outlook 365, addressed issues with jaws not   reading as expected when   navigating in the list of suggestions that displays   when  typing a   contact's name into a new message or calendar appointment.  . resolved a   customer reported issue where changes to voice profile settings   were not   being honored for the dectalk usb hardware synthesizer.  . addressed an issue   with both the dectalk express and dectalk usb hardware   synthesizers where   jaws would unexpectedly close when performing a sayall   from  a web   browser.  . when running jaws and zoomtext together in windows 7, resolved an   issue   where zoomtext's focus tracking was not working properly on the secure     desktop  or the logon screen.  . jaws visual tracking is now enabled by   default when navigating windows   html help content such as the jaws   help.  . a customer reported that jaws was not working as expected with a     particular java application. this issue has been resolved.  . resolved a   reported issue with the german version of jaws not working as   expected after   attempting to print or close a document in word 2013.  . fixed braille output   issues with hebrew.  list end           take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my   ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license   agreement.  in the   end you have to ignore everything, &amp;

2602,chrome browser," in fact, i don't think jaws 16 works with chrome. last september when an excel/office update caused excel to become unuseable for a couple of weeks with jaws 18 i reinstalled jaws 17 and jaws 16 in order to see if i could use these versions with excel. it turned out that jaws 16 did not cause excel to crash like it did with jaws 17 and 18, but i use google chrome as my primary web browser and it did not seem to work at all with jaws 16.  robby, is there a particular reason why you are still using jaws 15? i assume it might be because you didn't want to spend the money to maintain your sma which always entitles you to the latest version, but in the long run you are not doing yourself any favours and i am not sure if you actually save any money since somebody like you who has a 5-year old jaws version will have to pay an upgrade price in order to get up to speed. i guess you would have to call fs and find out, but at some point if you get a new computer with windows 10 even jaws 16 which initially worked with windows 10 will not do any more and you really want to be on jaws 2018 or, if you wait until the end of this year, jaws 2019. if you are anywhere close to a place where they have these conventions you might be able to get a super deal since fs always offered visitors of said conventions some super deal for upgrades or sma's.  of course there is always nvda which seems to do everything some of it's users need it to do and it's free unless you want to make a donation from time to time. let's face it, if nobody donated a dime and they didn't get some corporate sponsorship dollars nv access probably would not be able to offer the service they do now which is always why i did not understand people who think jaws should be free. fs/vfo is a business, they offer products and services which they have because they have a building, management, programmers and all that and they pay these people (many of whom are blind) and they pay for their building, utilities and computers and servers.     regards,  sieghard ",Answer

2689,classic firefox theme," i found this just now and thaught it might fix the wevism problem folks are having.  i recently installed firefox 29, which added several new features to the popular browser.    these are mainly a combination of user interface-related goodies and stability improvements. for example, users can now enjoy redesigned tabs and the ability  to customize the front-end by adding more buttons and functions.    firefoxlogo    while these customization options are definitely welcomed, however, firefox almost always seems to  break  or change something that didn t need to be touched  in the first place.    firefox 29 issues    the latest firefox 29 stops you from performing several, seemingly basic things that could frustrate those who are picky about their customization options.    among these changes include the inability to move the reload button from its default place or see the status bar the same way you used to.    the reload button now sits to the right of the address bar, while the status bar only shows items when they are installed.    additionally, it s important to note that the so-called status bar is now called the add-on bar.    the issue with the latter (at least in my case) is the fact that some of my frequently-used add-ons are not yet compatible with the latest firefox version  or its visual overhaul.    initially, i thought the best way to restore firefox to its former glory was to downgrade to a previous version. while this option technically works, it  is counter-intuitive.    then i found a firefox plugin (or add-on) called classic theme restorer.    what does classic theme restorer do?    the add-on performs a lot of the things that are shockingly unavailable in the latest firefox update. for example, you can move the reload button and restore  the old status bar (add-on bar) to the way it looked before. additionally, you can place your tabs toward the very top of the browser or underneath the  menu bar.    thankfully, all of my favorite features were working again when i installed classic theme restorer. this includes plugins/add-ons that were no longer functioning  under the new user interface.    note that the current firefox version remains the same; the plugin merely restores its former visual settings.    how to install classic theme restorer    click here   to download classic theme restorer.    click  add to firefox  followed by  allow  from the subsequent pop-up menu.    theme-restorer-add    theme-restorer-install    restart the browser when asked, and voila! you are all set with its installation.    how to customize firefox options    click the  tools  menu from the menu bar, then click  classic theme restorer.     customize any desired option as you see fit, including browser tab positioning and the inclusion of the classic status bar (again, now shown as the add-on  bar.)    theme-restorer-tools-menu    as you can see, every option you modified works like a charm again   including the return of the classic status bar:    theme-restorer-customize-screen    how to move firefox items    simply click an empty area toward the top of the browser (such as the empty space next to the menu bar) and then click  customize.  you will be greeted  with the following screen:    theme-restorer-dialog    drag and drop any of the available items on the main screen to the top of your browser. otherwise, drag and move any existing buttons at the top and drop  them anywhere you wish.    theme-restorer-customize-screen    i hope this helps anyone looking to move the firefox reload button, restore the classic menu bar and any other feature missing from this latest update.    ~ adrian ",Help

2818,commandline accessibility," i haven't done as much with the linux subsystem as i have cygwin in  the past but my experience so far is that it works pretty well. it  does have at least some of the same accessibility problems as the  console does after the anniversary update, for instance if text  scrolls off the top of the screen jaws will start reading from the top  where it used to only read the new text.    there are a few oddities, i installed emacs; if i do:  ""emacs &lt;filename&gt;"" emacs starts but the file is not loaded. i can do  ""c-x, f"" and then enter the file name and it does load, i am not sure  why specifying a file on the command line doesn't work.  one thing i really haven't looked at, ms says the linux subsystem is a  limited environment, i have not checked package availability compared  with cygwin to see if anything i use is unavailable.

2835,communication theory,"             we seem to have some challenges of late comprehending one another on     this list. it happens, especially in written communication. but if     you all will forgive the intrusion, i feel the need to explain a     fundamental concept of communication theory so we can get back to     the business at hand--which is helping one another with our jaws     issues. so please forgive me for what i hope will be helpful to all     in terms of promoting constructive communication. although much of     the following answers brian's prior message, i hope we can all learn     something from the following--i know i did just in writing it.          my ""sighted response"" comment was more of a slightly sarcastic way     of saying, ""but you're missing the point. we can't get there from     here, or at least, we don't know how to get there from here.""          point #1: i want to say that your descriptions of things are     generally useful, at least for someone like me who appreciates     understanding what my sighted friends are seeing. as i have     explained, what jaws says and how it says it doesn't always     replicate the layout that you see, and since i do what you do in     reverse--that is, teaching sighted people while being blind     myself--i find the visuals useful. having said that, they're not     always relatable--not because you're not good at it, but because of     something called frame of reference, which i will describe below.          point #2: i think some context may be helpful. while i don't presume     to speak for anyone on this list because people are all different, i     think it's probably fair to say that most of us have experienced     well-meaning people who want to help, but keep forgetting on some     level--conscious or subconscious--that our reality is not theirs.     case in point, i spent an hour showing someone my issues with the     ribbons, and no matter what i did, she kept trying to solve the     problem with the mouse. as you know, that's not an option for me,     but she couldn't break the habit. in the end, i got my point across,     but it was an intensely frustrating hour in which my blood pressure     probably went up twenty points.          so as i read your response to adrian's questions, and you kept going     back to the icon at the bottom of the screen and the popup menu, my     reaction was, ""but he can't, or doesn't know how to, get there from     here."" it's like i told my friend with the ribbons, ""it's great that     you can see it and you can get there, but how does that help me?""          your subsequent answer was helpful, as adrian pointed out, because i     never think to try shift f6. in my limited experience with the afore     mentioned problem, when i opened a pdf, i was trapped and could go     nowhere. but i never tried f6 or any variant thereof.          my degree is actually in communications, not computers or taxes or     anything i do now. but the first core concept we're taught, both in     communication theory and in interpersonal communications, is the     concept of frame of reference. basically your frame of reference is     the sum of all experiences you've had. so while i have no direct     experience with having sight, i do have knowledge of things that     people have told me or described to me over the years. each person's     frame of reference is going to be different. some of us have sight.     some of us used to have it. some of us never had it. some of us have     had things described to us in a way that we have a pretty good idea     of what it looks like, while others have no such concept.          so when i say, ""that's a sighted response,"" it's really not a slap     in the face. it's actually supposed to be a joking way to say,     ""there's a piece of that puzzle that i'm missing because you're     talking in visual blahblahblah that's not in my frame of reference,     although every sighted person in america would probably have gotten     it; hence, a sighted response'. try again."" your second effort was     much more successful as adrian pointed out.           likewise, sometimes we forget that you're not working directly with     jaws all the time, and there are things you can't relate to because     they're not in your frame of reference. as an example, for me on all     of my computers, firefox will lose focus and jaws will say,     ""netscape dispatch wnd."" i don't know why or what it means. it just     happens. you've probably never seen that, because as far as i know,     that phrase is never on the screen. i just live with it, hit the tab     key to regain focus, and go on with my life. but if i asked how i     could get rid of this ""netscape dispatch wnd"" message, you'd     probably think my computer was on drugs, because ""netscape dispatch     wnd"" is probably not in your frame of reference and certainly not on     your screen.          so to brian, i apologize if you took my remark as a slam; it was     never intended as such. there may have been a touch of frustration     in there because it does get tiresome when people recommend things     you can't do, no matter how well-meaning the intent. and to the rest     of us, we've got to realize that every person on this list has a     different frame of reference. so something that's a part of your     daily existence may never have been experienced by the other person     across the keyboard, and that's not just because we're blind or     sighted. it's because our collection of experiences is unique to us.          i really don't intend to start a thread with this. it just seems     that these kinds of miscommunications seem to be happening with     greater frequency, so i thought a little communication theory might     help. please note that any responses to this message or any other     probably won't be read until late tomorrow night, as i'm working a     full day in a tax center tomorrow.          so back to jaws, and remember that my frame of reference is not and     never could be entirely yours.          brad    brad@...

3010,configuring outlook 2016 with an outlook.com account," for anyone interested, the solution to the subject is there is a window   that pops up (that appears in windows, not outlook) that asks for your   account address and password that is not detected or accessible with   either jaws, nvda or narrator.    after starting outlook, the configuration wizard comes up to setup the   default profile to establish a connection and retrieve your email.  activate the yes buttons for the first two dialog and type in your name,   account address, password, and again to confirm the password is correct,   and finally activate the next button. once the mysterious window asking   for your address, password and activating the next/ok button is accessed   and completed, outlook 2016 will connect with the account.    as far as i can tell this frustrating experience occurs if outlook 2016   is operated in windows 10. i'm not sure if this also occurs in windows 7   (probably not).    so, if you have an outlook.com account that you'd like to use with   outlook 2016 (and possibly 2013) you will need sighted assistance. grrr.

3015,configuring outlook 2016 with an outlook.com account," probably not, because the issue is one of focus and navigation, not  labeling. thus, even if convenient ocr detects and accurately recognizes the  contents of the inaccessible dialogue box, that still won't solve the  problem of focusing jaws on the controls. has anyone experimented with the  touch cursor to see if that would do the trick. in several modern apps, i  was able to get jaws to detect controls with the touch cursor that neither  the pc cursor nor the jaws cursor recognized.    michal ",Answer
3023,connecting braille-edge 40 with screen readers and idevices,"           good morning everyone,                         my wife mary began working from home in january. until she's been using her pack mate for reading book files to be proofread. she's a braille proofreader with the education service center region 20. thanks to our networking business we bought a braille-edge 40 from hims inc. and paid cash on the nail for it along with the executive case. when the deal was done we spent over $3000.00. thanks again to our networking business we were able to skip the rehab line. hims has been paid in full for this device and the executive case.                         in order to do her work more efficiently when she works here she wants to connect the braille-edge 40 to her laptop in order to read files directly from that computer.                         yesterday we tried connecting the braille-edge 40 to the laptop and interface it with jaws for windows 2018. first we're not sure if the braille-edge driver is included in jfw 2018 or if we still need to install the driver on the cd that shipped with the unit.                         first we selected the ""braille-edge"" driver in braille options in jfw and added it to the list of braille displays and made the braille-edte the default braille display. at no time did jfw prompt us to install the braille-edge driver leading us to believe that the driver shipped with jaws 2018. we also restarted jaws after adding the braille-edge so these settings would take effect as directed.                         after this process was completed mary turned on the braille-edge 40 and attempted to put it into ""terminal mode."" she was able to select terminal mode but could not activate it using the commands given in the braille-edge 40 manual. we're not sure if the braille-edge 40 should have been turned on before or after jfw was restarted so jaws would recognize it so mary could begin reading her documents directly from the laptop.                         we attempted to contact both vfo and hims for assistance with resolving this issue. vfo kept us on hold for ages and we gave up in disgust. when mary tried calling hims all she got was a recorded message. we have already had negative tech support experiences with hims. mary had some other questions. instead of receiving a callback all she got from them was an e-mail message giving her the steps to address the issue in question. at least vfo keeps their support lines manned with live agents who can be very helpful when you can connect with them. considering what we spent with hims wee expect the same level of service from any assistive technology company we do business with.                         since hims has an office in austin and san antonio is only a 2-hour drive from austin there should be no problem for them to send someone down here to help us resolve this issue particularly since it's an employment-related matter. the only braille-edge user we know lives in dallas. if there are braille-edge users in the san antonio area that can assist us please contact us so mary can have this situation resolved before she starts work when her spring break is over. here is our contact information:         peter and mary donahue:    phone: (210) 826-9579    e-mail:    mary: braille@...    peter: pdonahue2@...

properly pair the braille-edge 40 with our idevices that will be very helpful. it wouldn't hurt to have directions on how to pair it with the mac should we decide to buy a mac to avoid a situation like this in the future.                         we thought that the inability to reach tech support might have been due to their being at csun as that conference occurs in march. further investigation indicated that csun doesn't begin until later this month. hims should have never left itself volnuurable to being called out on the internet. having their phones manned with live tech support would have insured that this message would never have been posted to these lists particularly since we paid cash for the braille-edge 40 and the executive case. had mary been able to reach someone to help us resolve these issues over the phone or if necessary anon-site visit from hims this message wouldn't be here today. when these issues are resolved we'll be fixed too. thanks for

can stay out of the proverbial cloud, the better. that's the reason why version 6 is subscription-based. you're paying that monthly fee for somebody to maintain your password vault on somebody else's server, which, in my unhumble opinion, is a compromise. i don't like, never have liked, the idea that cloud-based backup means you give your data to somebody else to hold for you, somebody you don't know and think you should trust just because they say you should. take this to its ultimate extreme, and you'd be right in saying that i don't like banks either. having worked for two for twenty-six years, what goes on behind the teller's window could fill a book. yes, they pay you for the privilege of parking your money there, but the things for which that money is used, and how the return on your loan of that money to the bank, called and investment, is gotten, well, it'd curl your hair. it sure curled mine! so keep your data out of the cloud as much as you can. back up your password vault and give it to a relative to hold, or someone else whom you can really trust, someone who won't charge you for the service.      on 3/7/2018 9:04 am, john gurd via groups.io wrote:  &gt; hi

3024,connecting braille-edge 40 with screen readers and idevices,"                    peter,             first i m assuming that you are trying to connect it via usb?      if so make sure that the switch on the left side of the edge is forward, or switched away from the braille b. the other piece of advice is that you always want the edge in   terminal mode before activating jaws. jaws will not recognize the edge if connected when jaws is already loaded. this is an annoying quirk with jaws.               as for pairing it to her iphone, start by switching the switch on the left side toward the braille b, or toward the back of the device. again make sure the edge is in terminal   mode. next, go to settings, general, accessibility, voiceover, braille, and double tap on the edge in this list. you will be prompted for a pairing code on the phone, enter 0000(that s four zeros) and double tap pair in the upper right corner. i advise that   she uses the phone with a bluetooth connection and usb connection for the computer.               i hope this helps, i wrote this in a hurry, but i wanted to assist you.             paul sandoval      blind tech training      expanding

3053,contact," yes, works fine with jaws. do you mean you couldn't enable screenshots or you couldn't set up onedrive at all?  here is how i enable the screenshots:    1. jaws key+f11 to bring up the sys tray items, arrow to onedrive and press enter  2. arrow down to settings and press enter, for some reason sometimes this just puts me back at the top of the menu and i have to arrow to settings a second time and press enter, then settings opens.  3. i am always in the account tab on ""add account"" so i do a shift+tab to get to the tabs and they are as follows (i use speech history from here on):    settings tab account tab auto save tab network tab office tab about tab  account tab - just did a ""say word"" to show what has focus  auto save tab - just did a right arrow to go there  now i tab and it reads the items in the auto save tab, the first items, pictures and documents have two options, ""onedrive"" or ""this pc only""  note, however, that i believe these options only exist with windows 10 when you are logged in with a microsoft account, on my windows 7 pc it goes straight to the ""save pictures automatically"" item for when you connect a phone or usb stick.  as you can see the last item before you get to ""ok"" is the checkbox for automatically capture screenshots to onedrive.  desktop, documents and pictures pictures combo box   this pc only  2 of 2  desktop, documents and pictures combo box   documents  this pc only  2 of 2  photos and videos automatically save photos and videos to onedrive whenever i connect a camera, phone, or other device to my pc check box not checked   screenshots automatically save screenshots i capture to onedrive check box checked   ok button      regards,  sieghard ",Answer

3056,contact," hmm, not sure why that is, it always was as simple as opening the onedrive application and signing in with my microsoft id for me. you then have a chance to specify a location where you want the onedrive folder just as with dropbox, by default it's in your user folder, and i think that's pretty much it.  i am quite sure if you want to set it up that microsoft accessibility can easily help you with that. i have an office 365 subscription both a home subscription which i share with my wife and mom as well as a business premium subscription for my business, both come with 1 tb of storage so it would of course be silly to pay for dropbox premium or whatever they call it when i already have all the storage i could want and i would have the office 365 subscription anyways because i need access to outlook, excel and occasionally some of the other office apps.  the office 365 subscription is one of the best deals around considering all it includes.    regards,  sieghard ",Answer

3124,continuing problem with navigating e-mail group,"          hi tom,     you are referring to outlook s contact groups feature, right?     as i navigate the list of members in a contact group, i have to shift+tab and then tab back to the list to hear the item in focus. so for example, if i am on the first item, and i press down arrow or right arrow to move to the next item, i hear nothing; i shift+tab and tab to get back to the list, and then, i do hear that i have indeed moved to the next item in the list. home and end do take me to the beginning and end of the list, which i confirm by shift+tab followed by tab to get back to the list after i have pressed home or end to see where i have ended up.     this seems to be a microsoft issue, as i tried it with nvda also and got same results      i am using windows 10, but i would think that our results would be the same, as i am also using office 2016 and jaws 18.     hope it helps!       regards,  maria                  ",Answer

straight on to the section,   advanced preferences for your group subscription  , for the preferences that give you precise control over the messages you ll receive from groups.io, and in what format, afterward review the section,   groups.io message reply and other options sent in individual messages and digests  .   note:  the easiest way to log out of the groups.io web interface is simply to enter     https://groups.io/logout     in the address box of your browser and then navigate to that page.  you don t need to locate the link showing your name, activating it to get the drop down menu, then choosing log out from that menu.                   getting a password to log in to the groups.io website          if you ve subscribed via e-mail you have a groups.io login id, your e-mail address, but you ve never been assigned a password for the website.  to get one:        1.      in your web browser, go to the groups.io main site login page:     https://groups.io/login         2.      find the  forgot your password?  link and activate it.        3.      a page with a single edit box, e-mail address will open.  enter your e-mail address in it.        4.     navigate to the one and only button on the page,  email link to log in,  and activate it.        5.     watch your e-mail, including your spam/junk box, for a message from groups.io that will contain a link you need to activate that takes you to your groups.io profile page where you set your password.  this is the password you ll use to log in to any groups.io group webpage where you wish to do something, such as changing your preferences, that requires you to be logged in to do.  you are, at this stage, actually logged in.                                                  advanced preferences for your group subscription          adapted for screen reader users by timothy wynn                   these preferences allow you to get  very  precise control over what messages you will receive in e-mail from groups.io and the format in which you ll receive them .  you can significantly decrease the amount of e-mail you receive from high-traffic groups while also being able to decide what's important enough to keep an eye on.       once you get to the main groups.io webpage,    https://groups.io   , you will need to navigate to the ""log in"" (two words) link and activate it. once you've entered your username, which is the e-mail address you've used to subscribe to the group(s) you routinely read, and password, activate the ""log in"" button and you will be taken to the ""your subscriptions"" page.         if your browser window is not already maximized, do so now (keyboard shortcut is alt+space, then x or windows+up-arrow).         if the page is restored or minimized, then at the top of the page you'll see a button labeled ""toggle navigation"", followed by a link with a graphic labeled ""groups.io"". this version of the interface will not allow you to edit any of the subscription preferences as far as i can tell.      if the page is maximized, then the top of the page should have a link with a graphic labeled ""groups.io"", followed by a link labeled ""your groups"".         use your screen reader's table navigation commands to move to the first table found on this page. the columns should read ""group"", ""# members"", ""latest message"", and ""delivery"". move to the row for the group for which you wish to set up your advanced preferences, navigate over to the delivery column, and activate the link found there.  this will bring up the subscription page which contains the advanced email preferences.   you will have to start back at this step for each group for which you wish to set up the advanced mail preferences.       just so you're aware these are on the subscription page, there is a radio button cluster for the  email delivery  options: all messages, full featured digest, plain digest, daily summary, special notices only, no email. this is immediately followed by two checkboxes related to using a signature: use signature for web posting and use signature for e-mail posting. these are followed by the signature edit box, should you wish to set up a signature that goes on to all your messages if you check one of the previously mentioned checkboxes.      use your screen reader quick navigation command to find  and  activate the ""advanced preferences"" heading level 3 link.      there are three major sections to the advanced preferences:         message selection. there are two radio buttons: all messages and following only. if the first is selected then every message sent to the group will be sent to you in the format you selected for e-mail delivery. if you select following only then the only messages you will receive are messages you've chosen to follow. there is a checkbox associated with ""following only,"" ""first message also."" if this checkbox is checked it serves as a selective override such that the first message in any new topic is sent to you so that you can see it and elect to follow it with the link at the end of the message if you wish to keep monitoring this topic.      replies. there is a checkbox, ""auto follow replies,"" which will make any topic that you start yourself, or any topic in which you reply to a message, followed. this checkbox is generally only used if you have elected to use the ""following only"" feature for message selection.      max attachment size (only for groups that allow attachments). this is followed by a dropdown box that allows you to choose from four different maximum sizes for attachments to be delivered to you via e-mail. the default is unlimited size. if you're using an internet service with data caps you may wish to change this. if you choose the zero option it means that all attachments will be stripped before a message is sent to you.         find the ""save"" button and activate it to save these settings.         as you can see, if you choose a setup where you have elected to get messages with the ""following only"" option combined with the ""first message also"" checkbox this will greatly decrease the flow of e-mail you receive while allowing you to decide for each topic whether you wish to follow it to receive further messages or not. if you do nothing then you will not receive any additional messages for that particular topic unless you hit the link to follow it at the end of the message or reply to it, if the ""auto follow replies"" option was checked.                      groups.io message reply and other options sent in individual messages and digests        at the   end of each individual  message   is this collection of links:      1.            view/reply online    followed by the groups.io message number

3263,copy and paste," i think copying from a website depends a lot on the website and the browser. for example, it is not possible to copy for example the item description on amazon, at least not on amazon.ca and not with ie or chrome.  also, i have been using google chrome as my primary browser lately and while for the most part i really like it, it seems copying does not work as well as with ie. i can go to the same website with ie and copy a few lines whereas with chrome i cannot and at best i have to do a select all, then copy and paste everything into notepad and use control+f to find the information, then delete everyting from the start of the information to the beginning of the document, locate the end of the information and delete everything from there to the end of the document. maybe somebody will tell me if i am wrong and this is a jaws issue, but since i can copy the same selected information on a website with ie and not with chrome it would make me conclude it is a browser/website issue.  i know that a web developer can, for example, code the website so that any pictures on the website cannot be saved by right clicking on the picture and select the ""save picture"" option from the context menu that comes up. on other websites that is not a problem and i wonder if in the same way a web developer can restrict the ability to copy text from a website.    regards,  sieghard ",Answer

3268,copy and paste,"                 hi david &amp; all,             placemarker info below:           placemarkers    a placemarker is a bookmark that you can easily add to a web page, html, pdf,   or word document, or form to mark a location. this is useful when you want to   return to commonly used areas on a web page, important sections or paragraphs of   an html document, or specific parts, such as required fields, of a complicated   form. placemarkers can be defined as temporary or permanent and can be anchored   to text, elements of the current web page, or to a web site's domain. multiple   placemarkers can be added to html or pdf documents, while only one can be added   to a word document.     the following describes how to add, rename, or delete placemarkers. if you   are not familiar with placemarkers and need more information, refer to  important   placemarker concepts . for additional placemarker operation, refer to  advanced   placemarker usage . for general information about using placemarkers in a   word document, refer to  marking   and returning to a placemarker in word .    adding a temporary placemarker    to quickly add a temporary placemarker, do the following:       open a web page, other html document, or word document.       move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put     the placemarker.       press  ctrl+windows key+k . a temporary placemarker now     appears on the page.     you can always jump to it using any of the     following  navigation     quick keys :  k ,  shift+k ,      shift+  number row keys  7  through      0 , or  ctrl+shift+k . (the last keystroke     opens the placemarker list. select temporary from the list, and then choose     the move to button.)      selecting between the temporary placemarker and the cursor position    to select text between a temporary placemarker and your current position in a   web page, html document, or word document, do the following:       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to set a temporary placemarker.       navigate to another location on the web page or document, then press      insert+spacebar, m . all text between the temporary     placemarker and your current cursor position is selected and ready to be     copied to the clipboard.      this method is often easier than using the  shift key  in   conjunction with the  arrow  keys when attempting to select large   blocks of text.    adding permanent placemarkers to web pages or html documents    to add a placemarker, do the following:       open a web page or other html document.       move the virtual cursor to the location on the page where you want to put     the placemarker.       press  ctrl+shift+k  and then  enter .       the add placemarker dialog box opens with focus in the name edit field. it     contains text that appears at the cursor location. if you want to change the     placemarker name, type a new name in this field; otherwise, press      tab  to move to the next control.       the define for all pages on current domain check box is cleared by     default, which allows the placemarker to be anchored only to the current web     page or html document. if you want to use this placemarker so that it is     anchored to all pages within the current domain instead, press      spacebar  to select the check box. press  tab      to move to the next control.       the anchor to text check box is cleared by default. select this check box     if you want to link the placemarker with specific text, such as a heading,     that appears on the page. this can be useful on frequently updated web pages     where text and elements tend to drift from their original position. when     selected, the next control, anchor text edit field, automatically populates     using the original text in the name edit field. this guarantees that the     placemarker will always be associated with this text on the web page.       press  tab  to navigate to the ok button and press      spacebar  to close the dialog box and save the placemarker.          renaming placemarkers    to change the name of a placemarker, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to rename.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of placemarkers on     this page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select the placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the change name button or press      alt+c .       enter a new name for the placemarker and then press  spacebar      on the ok button.      removing placemarkers    to remove one or more placemarkers, do the following:       open the page containing the placemarker you want to delete.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to display a list of all placemarkers     on the current page.       use the  up arrow  or  down arrow  keys to     select a placemarker.       press  spacebar  on the remove button or press      alt+r  to delete the placemarker.       tip:  if you want to delete all placemarkers   for this page, press  spacebar  on the remove all button or press    alt+l .    important placemarker concepts    the following sections, placemarker keystrokes, temporary versus permanent   placemarkers, and url versus domain placemarkers, are key to understanding   placemarkers with jaws.    placemarker keystrokes for web pages, html documents, or forms       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to insert a temporary     placemarker.       press  insert+spacebar, m  to select text between the     temporary placemarker and your current cursor position.       press  ctrl+shift+k  to open the placemarker list dialog     box to add a new placemarker, rename or change existing placemarker     parameters, jump to placemarkers, or delete placemarkers.         press  k  to jump to the next placemarker.       press  shift+k  to jump to the previous placemarker.       press number row keys  7  through  0  to     hear the content of placemarkers 1 through 4.       press  shift+  number row keys  7  through      0  to jump to placemarkers 1 through 4.       press  alt+windows key+k  to speak all of the placemarkers     on a web page or in an html document.      placemarker keystrokes for word documents       press  ctrl+windows key+k  to set a placemarker at the     current cursor position. only one placemarker can be set per word document.       press  alt+windows key+k  to return to the marker in a word     document.       press  insert+spacebar, m  to select text or items from the     marker to the current cursor position.      temporary versus permanent placemarkers    you can add a temporary placemarker anywhere on a web page by pressing    ctrl+windows key+k . this lets you easily mark a spot that you   can return to later by pressing  k . only one temporary   placemarker may be set per web page. if you later decide to move the temporary   placemarker to a different place on the web page, just move the virtual cursor   to that new location and press  ctrl+windows key+k  again.    if you want to make the temporary placemarker permanent, press    ctrl+shift+k  to open the placemarker list dialog box and add it   to the list, which lets you keep and maintain multiple placemarkers on the web   page, html document, or form. the last location where you set a temporary   placemarker is saved until you move it again, or remove the placemarker from the   placemarkers list dialog. you can browse to other web pages, exit jaws, even   restart your computer, and your temporary and permanent placemarkers are   preserved.    url versus domain placemarkers    jaws lets you assign placemarkers to either the current web address (the url   displayed in the address bar) or domain (the overall web site name). the url   (uniform resource locator) is the web address displayed in the address bar. you   can only use placemarkers assigned to the current url when you are visiting that   page.     individual web pages are contained within a domain. the domain's name is   usually the first portion of the page's web address and ends with .com, .net,   .org, .gov, .edu, or similar suffix. when you add a domain placemarker to a web   page, you can use that placemarker on any page within the current domain. since   many sites use a consistent design for all of their pages, the placement of   links, graphics, buttons, and form fields is often similar. if this is the case,   you can use a single domain placemarker to navigate many other pages on the   site.     for example, if a web site has a search box located at the top of each page,   you can put a domain placemarker there named ""search."" you can then use this   placemarker to move to the search box on any page in the domain, regardless of   the url.    advanced placemarker usage    the following describes other ways to customize and display placemarkers.       sharing placemarkers    you can use settings packager to share your placemarkers for a web site with   other jaws users. settings packager is a program that lets you save speech and   sound schemes, placemarkers, and personalized web settings in a compressed .zip   file that you can send in an e-mail message, post on a web site, or copy to   removable storage media. you can also use settings packager to import the   settings contained in these .zip files into jaws. to start settings packager,   press  insert+f2 , select ""settings packager,"" and press    enter . for more information on using this program, open the   settings packager help menu and choose help topics.    to share your placemarkers with other jaws users without using settings   packager:        open your jaws user settings folder from the start menu, all programs,     jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws, explore my     settings.       move to the placemarkers folder and press  enter .       placemarker information is stored in .pmi files. locate the .pmi file with     the same name as the page containing the placemarkers you want to share.       copy this file and distribute it to other users. these users then need to     copy the .pmi file on their placemarkers folder by going to the start menu,     all programs, jaws x (where x is the jaws version number), explore jaws,     explore my settings and open the placemarkers folder. the users can now     navigate that html page with your placemarkers.      custom page summary    when you open an html page, the custom page summary feature automatically   lists each placemarker on the page and its associated text. this lets you   quickly review the text located near your placemarkers so you can hear any   changes or updates to those areas of the page. to enable or disable this   feature, do the following:       open settings center ( insert+f2 ) or quick settings     ( insert+v ).       in the search edit box, type ""placemarker"" without the quotes.       press  down arrow  to move to custom placemarker page     summary in the filtered results of the tree view. (note that for web browsers,     this option appears in both the virtual cursor options group and the     personalized web settings group.)       press  spacebar  to toggle through the following settings.             select ""speak placemarkers on page load"" to have jaws read the name of     each placemarker on the current page as well as the text that appears near the     placemarker's location.       select ""list placemarkers in results viewer on page load"" to have jaws     display the placemarker information for the page in the results viewer. the     results viewer provides a link with the name of the placemarker and the text     that appears near the placemarker's location on the page. you can use the      arrow  keys to move to a link and then press      enter  to move to that placemarker.       select ""do nothing"" to have jaws provide a custom page summary.       see also:      placemarkers   in word                    back                    next             take care.  mike        take care.  mike.  go dodgers!  sent from my   ibarstool.  arguing with a woman is like reading a software license   agreement.  in the end you have to ignore everything, &amp; click i   agree.

3418,creating a shortcut in windows 10,"     adding a desktop shortcut under windows 10       this is done differently from prior versions of windows and the technique varies depending on whether the thing you want to create the shortcut for is for file or folder versus a windows built-in  app (e.g. mail, people) , store app or installed desktop app (e.g. ms word, adobe reader, etc.).      for installed desktop apps (formerly known as programs you ve installed) or windows built-in apps or store apps you ve installed:     1.           this involves using a very seldom used view for applications that is most easily invoked using the run command.  hit windows key+r then enter the following, without the quotes,  shell:appsfolder , then hit enter.     2.           you will now get a file explorer window that shows you nothing but all the applications that are installed on your computer whether these are windows built-in apps, store apps you later installed, or installed desktop apps.     3.          navigate to the app for which you want the desktop shortcut and select it.  under windows 10 alone i am able to use the first letter of the app in question to get to its general area then keep hitting that letter and it advances to the next app starting with that same letter.  you can jump directly to the first app that starts with any letter.  if you re a really fast typist you can start typing the name of the app itself rapidly and you should land on it, or something very near to it.  this is working for me even when the screen reader is running because it s a windows feature.     4.          hit the applications/menu key or shift+f10 if your machine doesn t have it.  this will invoke a context menu for the selected app.     5.          either hit the letter  s , which will directly invoke the  create shortcut  option, or arrow down until you hear  create shortcut  announced then hit enter.     6.          you will immediately get a dialog that tells you that,  windows can t create a shortcut here.  do you want the shortcut to be placed on the desktop instead?,  to which you will, of course, answer  yes.      7.          you now have a shortcut on the desktop.  this shortcut will have the name of the app in question followed by a hyphen and the word shortcut.  if you re like me you ll want to rename that shortcut to get rid of that hyphen and the word shortcut, but this is entirely optional.     for quick access to specific files or folders you d like on the desktop:     1.           if you happen to know where the object you want the desktop shortcut for is located, navigate to the folder that contains it, then select it.    proceed directly to step number 4.     2.           if you don t know the location your best bet is to use windows search and enter search criteria that are enough to get you a short list of possible results.  very often what you re looking for will be the first thing returned if you choose decent search terms.  once you ve found the object you wish to make the shortcut for when reviewing the results make sure you have focus on it then proceed to step 3.     3.          hit the applications/menu key if your computer has it, or shift+f10 if it does not, and a context menu should come up.  choose  open file location  from this context menu.  this will open the folder that contains the program, file, or subfolder you had focus on and it will already be selected.     4.          hit the applications/menu key or shift+f10, then do one of the following:     a.          hit n (which invokes the send to) option, followed immediately by d (which invokes the desktop create shortcut option).  you re finished.     b.          arrow down until you hear that you have focus on the send to option, hit enter, then in the submenu for send to arrow down until you hear  desktop (create shortcut)  and hit enter.  you re finished.        --       brian                 ""be yourself"" is the worst advice you can give         to some people.                  ~ tom masson    ",Answer

3550,crowd funding," if you haven't heard about crowdfunding you must not listen to the news, there is always somebody who does it to cover, as peter said, expenses for a medical procedure, a funeral because maybe the primary earner of a family with kids died or got killed etc. unfortunately you also often hear about people who think society is responsible to fund their education or their travels around the world and occasionally you hear of people who use natural disasters and the good will of others to raise money for themselves by pretending they have lost everything during a hurricane, wild fire etc.  then of course there are sites like kickstarter or indiegogo which are exclusively dedicated for raising funds for a service or product.  one of the most popular for personal crowdfunding is probably gofundme.com and yes, these sites to of course charge some percentage or fee for use of their site/platform.  maybe i was raised differently, but i couldn't do this at all, either i can afford to buy something or i can't, if i want it bad enough i work hard and save so i can afford it.  anyhow, i think peter made his point and some of us responded and made theirs and we should probably conclude this thread since it has precious little to do with the jaws list except that peter is trying to raise money for his and his wife's hardware and software purchases. i hope you remember to declare your future crowdfunding income with the irs since it may be considered income and therefore is subject to income tax.    regards,  sieghard ",Answer

 from the website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crowdfunding      crowdfunding     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia     crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the internet.[1] crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and of alternative finance. in 2015, it was estimated that worldwide over us$34 billion was raised this way.[2][3]     although similar concepts can also be executed through mail-order subscriptions, benefit events, and other methods, the term crowdfunding refers to internet-mediated registries.[4] this modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who proposes the idea and/or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the ""platform"") that brings the parties together to launch the idea.[5]     crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range for-profit entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, or community-oriented social entrepreneurship projects.[6]           contents  [hide]   1 history  2 types

comte[7][unreliable source?]  crowdfunding has a long history with several roots. books have been crowdfunded for centuries: authors and publishers would advertise book projects in praenumeration or subscription schemes. the book would be written and published if enough subscribers signaled their readiness to buy the book once it was out. the subscription business model is not exactly crowdfunding, since the actual flow of money only begins with the arrival of the product. the list of subscribers has, though, the power to create the necessary confidence among investors that is needed to risk the publication.[8]     war bonds are theoretically a form of crowdfunding military conflicts. london's mercantile community saved the bank of england in the 1730s when customers demanded their pounds to be converted into gold - they supported the currency until confidence in the pound was restored, thus crowdfunded their own money. a clearer case of modern crowdfunding is auguste comte's scheme to issue notes for the public support of his further work as a philosopher. the ""premiere circulaire annuelle adress e par l auteur du systeme de philosophie positive"" was published on 14 march 1850, and several of these notes, blank and with sums have survived.[9] the cooperative movement of the 19th and 20th centuries is a broader precursor. it generated collective groups, such as community or interest-based groups, pooling subscribed funds to develop new concepts, products, and means of distribution and production, particularly in rural areas of western europe and north america. in 1885, when government sources failed to provide funding to build a monumental base for the statue of liberty, a newspaper-led campaign attracted small donations from 160,000 donors.[8]     crowdfunding on the internet first gained popular and mainstream use in the arts and music communities.[10] the first noteworthy instance of online crowdfunding in the music industry was in 1997, when fans underwrote an entire u.s. tour for the british rock band marillion, raising us$60,000 in donations by means of a fan-based internet campaign. they subsequently used this method to fund their studio albums.[11][12][13] in the film industry, independent writer/director mark tapio kines designed a website in 1997 for his then-unfinished first feature film foreign correspondents. by early 1999, he had raised more than us$125,000 on the internet from at least 25 fans, providing him with the funds to complete his film.[14] in 2002, the ""free blender"" campaign was an early software crowdfunding precursor.[15][16] the campaign aimed for open-sourcing the blender 3d computer graphics software by collecting $100,000 from the community while offering additional benefits for donating members.[17]                 indiegogo's logo.  crowdfunding started to gain mainstream traction with the launch of artistshare (2003).[18] as the model matured, more crowdfunding sites started to appear on the web such as kiva (2005), indiegogo (2008), kickstarter (2009), and microventures (2010).[19][20]     the phenomenon of crowdfunding is older than the term ""crowdfunding"". according to wordspy.com, the earliest recorded use of the word was in august 2006.[21]     types[edit]     the crowdfunding centre's may 2014 report identified two primary types of crowdfunding:  1.rewards crowdfunding: entrepreneurs presell a product or service to launch a business concept without incurring debt or sacrificing equity/shares.  2.equity crowdfunding: the backer receives shares of a company, usually in its early stages, in exchange for the money pledged.[22]     reward-based[edit]     reward-based crowdfunding has been used for a wide range of purposes, including motion picture promotion,[23] free software development, inventions development, scientific research,[24] and civic projects.[25]     many characteristics of rewards-based crowdfunding, also called non-equity crowdfunding, have been identified by research studies. in rewards-based crowdfunding, funding does not rely on location. the distance between creators and investors on sellaband was about 3,000 miles when the platform introduced royalty sharing. the funding for these projects is distributed unevenly, with a few projects accounting for the majority of overall funding. additionally, funding increases as a project nears its goal, encouraging what is called ""herding behavior"". research also shows that friends and family account for a large, or even majority, portion of early fundraising. this capital may encourage subsequent funders to invest in the project. while funding does not depend on location, observation shows that funding is largely tied to the locations of traditional financing options. in reward-based crowdfunding, funders are often too hopeful about project returns and must revise expectations when returns are not met.[10]     equity[edit]     equity crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations through the provision of finance in the form of equity.[26][27] in the united states, legislation that is mentioned in the 2012 jobs act will allow for a wider pool of small investors with fewer restrictions following the implementation of the act.[28][29] unlike nonequity crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding contains heightened ""information asymmetries"". the creator must not only produce the product for which they are raising capital, but also create equity through the construction of a company.[10] equity crowdfunding, unlike donation and rewards-based crowdfunding, involves the offer of securities which include the potential for a return on investment. syndicates, which involve many investors following the strategy of a single lead investor, can be effective in reducing information asymmetry and in avoiding the outcome of market failure associated with equity crowdfunding.[30]     software value token[edit]     another kind of crowdfunding is to raise funds for a project where a digital or software-based value token is offered as a reward to funders which is known as initial coin offering (abbreviated to ico). value tokens are endogenously created by particular open decentralized networks that are used to incentivize client computers of the network to expend scarce computer resources on maintaining the protocol network.[31] these value tokens may or may not exist at the time of the crowdsale, and may require substantial development effort and eventual software release before the token is live and establishes a market value. although funds may be raised simply for the value token itself, funds raised on blockchain-based crowdfunding can also represent equity, bonds, or even ""market-maker seats of governance"" for the entity being funded.[32] examples of such crowdsales are augur decentralized, distributed prediction market software which raised us$4 million from more than 3500 participants;[32][33] ethereum blockchain; digix/digixdao;[34] and ""the dao.""[35][36][37][38] some of the largest token crowdsales in 2017 were tezos which raised us$232 million, bancor which raised us$153 million and status which raised us$102 million[39].     debt-based[edit]     see also: peer-to-peer lending     debt-based crowdfunding (also known as ""peer to peer"", ""p2p"", ""marketplace lending"", or ""crowdlending"") arose with the founding of zopa in the uk in 2005[40] and in the us in 2006, with the launches of lending club and prosper.com.[41] borrowers apply online, generally for free, and their application is reviewed and verified by an automated system, which also determines the borrower's credit risk and interest rate. investors buy securities in a fund which makes the loans to individual borrowers or bundles of borrowers. investors make money from interest on the unsecured loans; the system operators make money by taking a percentage of the loan and a loan servicing fee.[41] in 2009, institutional investors entered the p2p lending arena; for example in 2013, google invested $125 million in lending club.[41] in 2014 in the us, p2p lending totalled about $5 billion.[42] in 2014 in the uk, p2p platforms lent businesses  749 million, a growth of 250% from 2012 to 2014, and lent retail customers  547 million, a growth of 108% from 2012 to 2014.[43]:23 in both countries in 2014, about 75% of all the money transferred through crowdfunding went through p2p platforms.[42] lending club went public in december 2014 at a valuation around $9 billion.[41] debt crowdfunding in the u.s. further evolved with the 2016 enactment of title iii of the jobs act, which allows unaccredited investors to invest directly in private businesses through regulated funding portals or broker-dealers.[44]     litigation[edit]     litigation crowdfunding allows plaintiffs or defendants to reach out to hundreds of their peers simultaneously in a semiprivate and confidential manner to obtain funding, either seeking donations or providing a reward in return for funding. it also allows investors to purchase a stake in a claim they have funded, which may allow them to get back more than their investment if the case succeeds (the reward is based on the compensation received by the litigant at the end of his or her case, known as a contingent fee in the united states, a success fee in the united kingdom, or a pactum de quota litis in many civil law systems).[45] lexshares is a platform that allows accredited investors to invest in lawsuits.[46]     donation-based[edit]     charity donation-based crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to help charitable causes.[47] in charity crowdfunding, funds are raised for pro-social or pro-environmental purposes.[48]     role[edit]     the inputs of the individuals in the crowd trigger the crowdfunding process and influence the ultimate value of the offerings or outcomes of the process. each individual acts as an agent of the offering, selecting and promoting the projects in which they believe. they sometimes play a donor role oriented towards providing help on social projects. in some cases, they become shareholders and contribute to the development and growth of the offering. individuals disseminate information about projects they support in their online communities, generating further support (promoters). motivation for consumer participation stems from the feeling of being at least partly responsible for the su",Help

3613,cursors in jaws,"          hi don,                  about jaws cursors, below all 4 of them  are explained.     navigating  through windows with jaws is accomplished with cursors. these     cursors determine the focus of jaws  speech and are often directly linked     with windows cursors.       the pc cursor - follows  keystrokes     this cursor is linked  to the keyboard functions of windows and      applications.     this is the cursor that is used when  typing information, moving through     options in dialog boxes, and selecting  options or icons. as you type     information, the pc cursor follows along  with each key you press. if you      are     making a selection in a menu or dialog  box, the pc cursor highlights the     currently selected object. the pc cursor  is activated by default when jaws     starts. if you are using a different  cursor, pressing num pad plus returns     you to the pc cursor.       the jaws cursor - follows mouse  pointer     the jaws cursor is  linked to mouse pointer functions in windows and other     applications. it is used to read  information the pc cursor cannot read,      such     as toolbar information. the mouse follows  along with the jaws cursor when      it     is moved, and you therefore have access  to information in an application     window that is beyond the scope of the pc  cursor. to activate the jaws     cursor, press num pad minus.       the virtual pc cursor - html  environment     the virtual pc  cursor mimics the functions of the pc cursor, but is     activated by default when entering an  html document. the virtual pc cursor     speaks the number of frames in a  document, and the number of links in the     frame. you can switch between frames, and  jaws reads graphics labeled by      alt     tags in the html code.            invisible  cursor        the jaws cursor is  basically the mouse cursor that is visible on screen.   the invisible cursor  can be moved around just like the jaws cursor to view   information.  it  works like the mouse cursor but can not be seen on screen   or effect  objects.  therefore you can not use the numpad / (left mouse   click) or  numpad * (right mouse click) on an object.  it is useful to read    information without disturbing the mouse cursor.  it is also useful to    determine colors or whatever might change when the mouse is over an object.    it will not cause tooltips to pop up.            take care, mike.  sennt from my ibarstool.  go dodgers!

3614,cursors in jaws," in recent versions of jaws there is also the touch cursor (i believe  this to be a poor name, something better would have been ""object  cursor""). the touch cursor allows navigating between screen elements  in a hierarchical manner as the program organizes them, and has two  modes normal and advanced. the advanced mode allows for navigating  through elements that cannot themselves gain focus (or necessarily  even appear as distinct items - invisible frames for example).    the benefit of this cursor mode over the jaws cursor is that you can  reach elements that the jaws cursor does not show. it it takes some  work on the part of program developers but if programs are written in  an accessible manner the touch cursor takes care of this issue.  and  it is becoming more of an issue as time goes by because the jaws  cursor can not see screen elements drawn using the newer directx  rendering path only those drawn with the older gdi technology.    to activate the touch cursor use shoft+numpad+ (numpad + twice quickly  to disable). i pretty much only use the advanced mode (toggled with  the numpad* key). in that mode you use the left and right arrow keys  to move between elements at the current level and the up and down  arrows to move up and down the object tree. space will trigger the  default action on the current element.    i am sure there are other things you can do while in the touch cursor  mode but those are the only ones i use.
