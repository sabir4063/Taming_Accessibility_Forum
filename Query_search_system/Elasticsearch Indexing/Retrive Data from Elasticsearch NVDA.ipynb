(it may be better to use one search engine for some purposes and another for others. google tailors search results to your interests so you may see articles reflecting your political point of view much more in the first many results, perhaps enough that you will miss variety you should be aware of. tailoring results in this way, encouraging entrapment in your own view is not a service and should be eliminated. if startpage doesn't do that, that's very good and a good reason to use it where such selection of results matters. but google has other advantages that are important and one that is especially important to blind users. i doubt that other search engines have the cache feature google has. i just checked startpage and it doesn't. with google, some sites aren't cached because they can request not to be. but this feature is far more useful than most, perhaps almost anyone, realizes. and it is particularly useful for blind people for the following reason: first, caching lets you see a page when the site is temporarily not available for some reason. but more than that, and of particular interest to blind users, if a pdf or some other format comes up in the results, such as a pdf article, if you use the cached version, you get the pdf shown as a web page, in html, converted by google. you don't have to do anything in terms of working with a browser plugin or converting it yourself. and i noticed when i was comparing that google has a similar link for each result. startpage doesn't. in short, it may be that results are the same or similar, when you are just looking at results, but caching isn't there and similar isn't there and they may be important at times, especially caching. i once was able to read an article in a format nothing on my machine handled. also, it isn't defeatist at all. as i said, i don't search when signed into my account, which makes matching me with my searches harder. i don't believe in tilting at windmills for no benefit. after the equifax data breach in the united states, and, if you follow technology news somewhat, you see that data breaches occur once or twice a week a lot of the time, i'm supposed to worry about whether

\"', 'tag': 'Answer'}, {'id': '32961', 'post': '\" just a general note: speech recognition technology has vastly improved over just the last several years and continues to do so. i dabbled in speech recognition when it was a new thing and found it almost useless. now google voice automatically creates a transcript of my incoming voicemail messages and, particularly for the sound quality involved via phone, does a very decent job. i haven\\'t tried the windows 10 built-in speech recognition, but would certainly recommend playing with that. dragon naturally speaking is a great product but certainly not alone out there in its basic speech recognition/speech-to-text arena anymore. speech recognition requires some getting used to no matter how good it may be, particularly making sure you mute your microphone when something else interferes with the work you\\'re doing. that, or turning off the function entirely. when you\\'re dictating a document it can be rather amusing to see what gets in there when the spouse, kids, or coworkers give you a holler for whatever and you respond, having forgotten to turn speech recognition off. one could change amusing to frustrating and the same applies. -- brian i worry a lot. . . i worry that no matter how cynical you become it\\'s never enough to keep up. ~ trudy, in jane wagner\\'s \\'search for signs of intelligent life in the

update for google drive and its now changed its name to google backup and store, but it has also seemingly gathered someone bugs. firstly, it randomly seems to ask you to log in to its account again, or it may suddenly crash out and present the usual messages about looking on line for a solution etc, or it decides if another window is open for a piece of software to bring up what appears to be an invisible window over the desk top when said application is closed, needing you to bring up the desktop again. the tray icon reflects the new name and tells you how long from the last sync it was. presumably this monitors the state all the time in case somebody else adds a file. seems pretty clunky and i see not real reason why it has been altered other than to do the usual google thing of
