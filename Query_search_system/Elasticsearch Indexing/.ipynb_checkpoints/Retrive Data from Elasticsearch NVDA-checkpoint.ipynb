      "[{'id': '4734', 'post': 'browsing hierarchical tree of comments \"                 i ask a question in this message and make a few   comments but the second half of the message discusses what might be a related   command, at least in terms of how you would program it.   perhaps if there   is enough interest on the list, the developers will work on it soon.                   the review corsor by default if you are using   object navigation follows the system cursor.   but what i\\'m saying is if you   only want to read the top level comments, then don\\'t you have to move to every   comment and measure the distance?   my question is how that is better than   reading a few words of each comment to see if you want to continue.   but   maybe you have to read enough of each comment that it is slower enough to   matter.                 evidently, the speak position command has more   functions than in the old version of nvda i use.   so you are correct that   to hear the numbers, you have to issue the command twice.         also, the idea of being able to jump to the next   occurrence of text starting a certain point from the left of the screen might be   related to another feature nvda should have.   if you have a page with two   or three columns or more and you want to only read one column, you should be   able to define a start point and an end point farther to the right.   then   you could read and only have that defineed column read.   asap had a read   column feature in jaws.   i seldo had to use it but i would imagine it was   very useful to some people,   consider one use with nvda:      suppose you got a poorly formatted pdf document where   pages didn\\'t decolumnize properly.   rather than have decolumnization occur,   if you could just have the page recognized with no decolumnization and set the   columns yourself, you might be able to read such documents.                 genea distance from the left of the screen           \"', 'tag': 'Answer'}]\n",
