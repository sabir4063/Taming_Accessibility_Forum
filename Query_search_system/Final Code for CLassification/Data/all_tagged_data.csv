    til you can mute in  @inboxbygmail  by pressing m.           josh todd (@joshtodd)  april 6, 2016      to help you decide whether you should switch over to inbox completely, we      ll show you some of the ways in which it      ll make email better for you. but first, let      s show you where everything is in inbox      s interface.    where inbox options are    you      ll find all of inbox      s options and settings in one of five locations:        the toolbar that appears when you hover over a message         this is where you      ll find the options to pin an email, snooze it, mark it as done (or move it to the inbox)                the pop-up menu that appears when you click on the move to       icon  (three dots arranged vertically) in the toolbar    shown    above     the icon-driven menu hidden behind the compose button         you      ll be able to see the menu when you hover over the big red plus (+) icon at the bottom right in inbox     inbox      s settings dialog         to bring this up, click on the hamburger icon at the top left in the inbox interface, and in the fly-out sidebar that appears, click on  settings                 individual bundle settings         to bring up the  settings  dialog for any bundle, hover on its link in the sidebar and click on the gear icon that appears next to it.            now let      s see how inbox saves you, the user, both time and effort.    1. turns your emails into to-dos    with gmail, you can  send emails as tasks to your to-do list  app, but with inbox, your email  is  your to-do list. inbox treats it as such because it understands that most emails need you to take    some kind of action.    inbox allows you to mark emails as       done       instead of       read       or       archived      . that may be a simple change of wording, but it does put a different spin on email management.     i'm loving inbox by gmail. making emails 'actionable' made the experience amazing for a to-do list junkie like me        mark 'done' #inboxbygmail            ashley mitchell (@amitchellidea)  october 29, 2014       emails that you mark as done get shunted out of your way.  it      s like checking tasks off your to-do list and is the equivalent of archiving in gmail.    you can also pin important emails to the top of your inbox for quick    access to them.    2. sorts email right for you    inbox takes the onus of sorting your email and does a pretty good job of it.  it places similar emails in groups called bundles.     when you      re setting up inbox for the first time, you      ll get a prompt to choose which type of emails you      d like to see grouped into a separate bundle. trips, promos, updates, forums, and finance are some of the bundle types that you can choose from.         use the  create new        sidebar link if you      d like to create a custom bundle. you can go back and tweak your bundle preferences anytime via inbox settings.    3. highlights just the    data you need    from flight times to car rental info to order confirmations, inbox is familiar with the kind of data that you      re usually looking for in your inbox. that      s why it keeps that  important data highlighted at all times in scannable cards for easy identification.          inbox also makes it easy to tell if an email has attachments, photos, inline images, links to videos, etc.,    by making    their    thumbnails visible in your inbox.         if you    mention    a link, a phone number, or an email address while creating a reminder in inbox, its     assist  feature    brings    up extra information that it thinks you might need.    we      re sharing this tweet as an example:     another win for  @inboxbygmail .  i set this reminder for myself a month ago, and inbox knows when my pharmacy opens!  pic.twitter.com/pumliylpnc            danger manley (@dangermanley)  march 30, 2016      you      ll appreciate that  inbox is smart enough to not display sensitive data like license keys in cards .    4. speeds up email replies    for any email that      s currently open, inbox lists three text snippets beneath the message. these are replies crafted by inbox to save you some time. click on any of the snippets and a new draft appears with that snippet pasted in the body of the reply email. you can review and    edit    the email before you hit  send .         inbox notes the changes you make and learns from them, crafting better response options with each iteration. it also works its way up to more complex sentences as you keep using the  smart reply  feature.    smart replies are available on the web and on mobile.     the  @inboxbygmail  auto-replies are creepily accurate. ai is making impressive strides. and saving me time. :-)           bart verkoeijen (@bgever)  april 8, 2016      5. speeds up searches    the problem with  email searches  is that you still have to look through the results to find key information. inbox knows that this can be time consuming    and does its best to push the right information to the top.  then  it shows you other relevant results in two groups:  top results  and  all results .    when i searched for  flight time  in inbox, right at the top it showed me the most relevant card that matched my query        a card highlighting the flight number as well as the departure date and time for the earliest upcoming flight. handy!         6. acts as your travel assistant     tracking travel plans  has never been this smooth. inbox has a dedicated bundle called a trip bundle that     gathers all emails related to each of your trips in one place . click on trips in the sidebar to view trip bundles for upcoming trips as well as completed ones. click on any of them and there      s all the right data you need!

(@aliguclu)  june 21, 2015      inbox is great, but          the quick and easy data access that inbox provides is made possible by the data-scanning mechanism built into it. this means that  inbox trawls your messages to bring up the information that      s most relevant to you.  creepy? it sure is, unless  the lack of privacy     doesn      t bother you much.    this intrusion into every part of your life is the biggest problem with inbox, granted that it      s an intrusion that has your blessings if you sign up for inbox.     started looking at inbox by google. became concerned about privacy. remembered i already use gmail so i don't have privacy anymore.           chris of comicbookdb (@comicbookdb)  november 7, 2014      except for the privacy    bit, none of inbox      s cons seem to be deal breakers.     a unified inbox feature would have been a useful    addition  for managing multiple google accounts in inbox though. for now, you      ll have to stick to account switching just like you do in gmail. a one-click delete option for emails would also have been nice.    unbox inbox!    you won      t know if inbox is worth making your primary email client unless you spend some time with it. get started on that today.    if it      s been  more than a year since you tried inbox  and went back to gmail, give it another shot, because inbox has evolved quite a bit between then and now.    the takeaway here is that if it      s efficiency that you      re looking for, inbox gives you an awesome    deal. not so much if privacy is your top concern at all costs.     have you switched to inbox by gmail? has it changed your email workflow for the better? did you hate it and go back to regular gmail? we      d love to hear about your experience with inbox.      image credit:  hourglass clock  by dima sobko via shutterstock            ""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"173","a couple more word quesions","""  hi kelby,   you are most welcome to purchase the book which does, indeed, cover most of these:   https://www.nvaccess.org/shop/       but to answer your questions:      moving quickly to misspelt words can be done with alt+f7.   this jumps to the next misspelt word and automatically opens the context menu which contains alternative words.   the issue with this is that you don't automatically see what the misspelt word itself is.   if you press escape you can close the context menu and the focus goes back to the document with the focus on the misspelt word so you can read the text around the word.      right clicking on a word is most easily done by simply moving the focus to the word and pressing the applications key.   this works exactly the same as right clicking on the word and you can see either alternative words if word thinks it's misspelt, or synonyms otherwise.    you can close task panes - some task panes have their own keystroke - for instance, press control+alt+shift+s to open the styles task pane, and close it using the same keystroke.   for most though, ensure the focus is on the task pane, press control+spacebar and choose close (press c).      note that you can also use shift+f6 to move through open panes and sections of the window in reverse order.      regards    quentin.

"190","a few comments on recent threads",""" 1. tutorials. several issues here, where are they, are they up to date, who is doing them and in what format are they?    i'd suggest if anyone wants to do audio ones the first thing to do is to use a slowed down voice. as we are talking to  people starting out, it takes time and maybe even never will get to a point where they can hear as fast as you do. also the voice should be something understandable and something available in all flavours of windows with no additional downloads.  do not assume anything, and be clear about the intention when you are demonstrating things.  of course it gets more complicated if you are also talking about tutorials in other languages than english, and sometimes the demo will need to be significantly different given the complexity of none latin based languages.  2 ribbons, the eternal war of words on these has broken out yet again.  to my mind there will always be this problem. some are simply not able to grasp the conventions, and i hold my hands up to being in this group. the best course i think is to simply point people at explanations and files to maybe try to make them go away wherever you can for those like me who are obviously thick in this area! certainly lets not  argue about them ad infinitum every couple of months.    3. bugs you think you have discovered in nvda.  firstly ask here, it could be a bug or it could be an issue with the machine or software on it. once you have exhausted the alternatives, at least try to get an account on github. (is there a tutorial for this too?) and report your findings there.although some developers do watch here, they can miss things just posted here amongst the noise of everyday queries. if you cannot actually figure out the issues reporting section of github, and it can be a bit daunting if you do not use online forms a lot, then subscribe to one of the lists such as the developers  one. these seem to be all listed with their subscription details on the nv access web site. then if you are baffled by github, and it being a relatively low traffic list, ask somebody to help you report it there. do not clutter that list with questions or crospost the posts here over there though, as they will not be as  tolerant of it as it seems they are here.  always read up on an issue first if you can.  4. testing nvda new features. in the main for most who just want to use nvda, then use the release version, but always have a back up portable version that you can run in an emergency from a keyboard shortcut.  this is especially  needed if you want to test snapshot builds, and rc releases, of course as if there are bugs its far easier to reboot to a known good version and them try to figure out what went wrong!  remember,  next snaps are very much untested ideas, master are beta releases and mostly work but occasionally do contain regressions that can trap the unwary. rc release candidate builds come in two flavours. thos on the snapshot pages which are basically the same as the release but still contain error sounds enabled and those often flagged up in messages to the various lists which are more or less full versions complete with error sounds removed.    5. if somebody here annoys you. go and take a walk before writing any reply to the list. often the words may sound critical or harsh, but most often this is because of the lack of human intonation. it might be slightly sarcastic or just a joke. best ignored if its obviously  badly meant, as flame wars can occur and nobody wins.  debate is fine but if you are not willing to listen then don't bother getting involved.    6. on a personal note, although i do try to read back through the days messages and make one reply, i am often thwarted by the time warp in email delivery from mailing lists, which can delay things by up to a day, meaning one has to reply again to take account of new info. this is not uncommon so don't jump on people unless its clear they are  responding to each and every message in a thread all the time. always read back a bit in the list before posting a question, as it could well be that its been asked before.this is evident in the many threads on at the moment about firefox 57, craptum.  grin. i suppose we all make mistakes and do not add to threads or indeed not change the sub line when the meaning alters.  anyway,  just needed to say some stuff, i'm off for a lie down now.  brian        bglists@...  sent via blueyonder.  please address personal email to:-  briang1@..., putting 'brian gaff'  in the display name field.

"198","a few comments on recent threads",""" to be honest for once i am probably on the side of fs which isn't usual.    firstly if you use windows media player native formats and don't use a real high quality format the digital noise stream is encoded in the file to, and you hear it.    a lot of radio stations that were in windows media and even low quality real media had this issue, always sounded like an old radio in   a shed with all the digital chatter.    the other thing is that a lot of tutorials especially the first manuals that came online especially if they were the same, for ages and ages were simply transposed from tapes.    now i know now you can get reasonable recording restoration software but tapes to get your data off especially in those days even if they were good quality tapes would get a lot of hiss and machine noise.    you can fix this some what, but if you try to restore a record and yes i hav tried to cleanup a record with goldwave and really made it where i really made it sound normal all i got was the same digital signal clutter unless in stereo then it wasn't so bad.    another thing, a lot of tapes were mono, and a lot of the tutorials these days are stereo.    and while a mono sound while a bit crappy in itself is just that, if you don't care the signal never was a real issue.    make that stereo or even think of converting then you have a problem.    while you can probably split a digital mono signal to stereo, if that was a mono device like a tape to digital, with all the stuff i mentioned about tapes previously, well tapes are just not ideal to record off of unless they are stereo tapes or you just don't care.    i did recordings of tapes not from tape to computer, but actually played the tapes and taped to a digital device via a microphone.    now i realise that this is or can be a problem if the environment aint right but its probably better if you can do it, since you are dealing with a digital file hearing the audio from a tape.    and the environment sadly but oh well.    you can't exactly use that for production as such but you could edit a file and do that.    but i was dealing with stereo tape recordings on good tapes and dictaphones.    its actually worse when you go digital to tape, fine for music but still.

"247","a few thoughts web aim survey quantity versus quality feeling burnt out and tutorials","""          dear nvda community,      as i read messages on recent discussions, i realized just how much enthusiasm and concern people have over nvda and its future. at the same time, it became clear to me that i and other developers and community elders need a day off and just listen to you all, as listening allows us to think about what others are saying and plan things accordingly.      but first, a humble opinion about surveys and other points:      first, when calls for the seventh web aim survey went out, i told people to not just do it to    increase    market share. i specifically told screen reader companies to not coerce users to do it, but let people take it out of their own willingness. this advice was to avoid a fiasco that happened with web aim 6 where ai squared (now part of vfo) staff told window-eyes users to fill out the survey in mass numbers, which became a small controversy within the screen reading world, and to me, making web aim results no longer credible.      as some folks pointed out, web aim numbers depend on how many people fill it out and where they come from (and this is true of any surveys where word of mouth drives participation). the results also depend on demographics and other factors such as choices given, how the questions are worded, and overall objective. if one or more data points seems to be dominant, they can be either skewed or outliers, with the more extreme cases being termed    outliers    and they affect how the results are explicated (interpreted). even skewed data, such as what i can perceive from some surveys including recent web aim iterations can affect statistical calculations to a point where it raises genuine questions about bias, credibility, and others (after all, success of statistics, particularly inferential statistics, depends on a representative sample or a close equivalent that allows researchers to approximate the real world, which is prone to errors if not done correctly such as misinterpretation, bad outliers, only some groups participating, not looking at things more deeply and what not).      one important thing to note is that web aim is a representative survey, thus the result in front of me could reflect reality. however, due to recent controversy, possible type i and ii errors (false-positive and false-negative, respectively) and because of outliers and skewed data and participation, it does not truly reflect actual data, which is a point some folks here are trying to say and i concur with. my explication of web aim 7 is that, in some parts of the world, jaws for windows is more popular. however, given the fact that not all geographical regions are represented, i   d counter by saying that this is not a true representative sample that includes every continent, and if it did, the story would be different and will reflect reality a bit better (not a lot because there are other ways of skewing data such as filling it out on behalf of an organization, robotic fillers and so on). coupled with the fact that web aim went through a major controversy recently that damaged its credibility somewhat, i would dare not trust web aim results again.      this leads to my second point: quantity versus quality. if nv access went straight for quantity alone, they could have implemented all possible feature requests in hopes of boosting market share. the reality in front of us says otherwise: not all feature requests are here. numerous factors contribute to this problem:       lack of leading developers: in 2017, a long-time nvda developer started working for another organization, and nv access has been looking for his replacement ever since. even if the replacement is found, it   ll take several months for him or her to become used to this community, learn about accessibility and how to interact with members, and earn our trust (it took reef turner a year to fully earn our trust). folks can counter this by saying that there are countless contributors out there, but ultimately what gets into nvda depends on pull requests and review time from nv access.  attitudes about open-source software from organizations: as some folks pointed out, there are prevailing attitudes about open-source in organizations that makes it a bit harder for nvda to land on their computers, which allows developers to assess true needs of organizations through user feedback. without valuable feedback from organizations (a quality one at that), we won   t see huger progress in nvda development.  outside attitudes about the nvda community: from the inside, nvda community is seen as a tight nit of enthusiasts who strives to make nvda better every day. on the outside, however, we have a mixed bag of reputations, from admiration to honorable mentions to disdain. every organization have these mixed reputations, especially more so for a community powered by technology such as linux kernel developers, web browser vendors and web standards organizations, and even screen reader community. not only we need to show that we are united inside, we need to showcase unity outside of this community.  inside matters just as outside: public relations outside of nvda community is important, but unity within an organization is just as important as public organizational face (i   ll address developer   s point of view below). what makes nvda stand out is our unity despite coming from different circumstances and backgrounds.       most of these point to quality, not quantity alone. in summary, quantity is important, but quality is just as important as how many people download nvda 2017.4 between christmas and new year.      lastly, in regards to organization internals, i   d like to address something i really wanted to say for the past few weeks: sometimes, i felt burnt out. my initial response to your enthusiasm over my audio tutorials was that i   ll ask for justifications for producing an updated version, seeing that there are countless free videos and tutorials out there. this was partly because i truly felt burnt out with academics, speech and debate competitions and what not (especially after a debate regarding a potential feature held not long ago), at one point telling myself that i   ll retire from the nvda community sooner than later and feeling as though i carried important burdens on my shoulders. but you didn   t see that justification post; instead, i posted links to where you can download the 2018 version of my audio tutorial series. in effect, i   ve given up my christmas holidays for this community, knowing that i needed a time to listen to you all and do something about it. all this was possible because of a simple act of listening and thinking about what the community means to me and what my work means to everyone. i   m committed to finishing welcome to nvda 2018 series before nvda 2018.1 ships, with several addenda coming after that, all because of support from this community and outsiders. and i promise again: the welcome to nvda 2018 series was, and will remain, free for all. all i ask of you in return is donate to a cause that makes equal access to technology possible, especially during this holiday season and beyond.      i   m sure for many of you, my musings above are a bit hard to digest. now you know why i don   t trust web aim survey results, quality is just as important as quantity, and read a confession from a community leader on his inner feelings. but there are two more things you need to know, something all of us needs to think about:      community leaders won   t stay with you forever. in early 2017, i sensed that a long-time nvda developer would leave this community for something better. only i and others didn   t know until summer that it would be jamie moving onto mozilla foundation.      i also felt, back in early 2017, that my active time with the nvda community is slowly drawing to a close. i don   t know when it   ll happen, but i   ve been laying foundations for the next generation of developers and enthusiasts to take the lead. this is one of the reasons for setting up the devlearning subgroup, because i felt it is time for me and other leaders to teach nvda internals and other concepts to the next group of community leaders and developers so they can bring nvda to the next level and do more amazing things than i and others did (in my case, for the past five years).      lastly, i sense a time when this community will face a sharp divide to a point where people will start questioning the merits of this community. i only told a select few earlier because it wasn   t right for me to disclose it early and for them to prepare a plan. the screen shade debate is, in fact, a sort of a preview of what is to come. one of the fundamental questions you will face at that time will be whether you still have your first love for nvda, and whether you still have your original reasons for joining this community. the survival of this community at that time will depend on your ability to unite to face a difficult situation, even if that means facing possible splits. one thing you should not do at that time: ignoring new users and outside critics, because they are influential opinion leaders and are key stakeholders in nvda   s future. one thing you should do though: listen to others and think critically.      hope this makes sense.  merry (early) christmas,  joseph

termed    outliers    and they            affect how the results are explicated (interpreted). even            skewed data, such as what i can perceive from some surveys            including recent web aim iterations can affect statistical            calculations to a point where it raises genuine questions            about bias, credibility, and others (after all, success of            statistics, particularly inferential statistics, depends on a            representative sample or a close equivalent that allows            researchers to approximate the real world, which is prone to            errors if not done correctly such as misinterpretation, bad            outliers, only some groups participating, not looking at            things more deeply and what not).          one important thing to note is that web aim            is a representative survey, thus the result in front of me            could reflect reality. however, due to recent controversy,            possible type i and ii errors (false-positive and            false-negative, respectively) and because of outliers and            skewed data and participation, it does not truly reflect            actual data, which is a point some folks here are trying to            say and i concur with. my explication of web aim 7 is that, in            some parts of the world, jaws for windows is more popular.            however, given the fact that not all geographical regions are            represented, i   d counter by saying that this is not a true            representative sample that includes every continent, and if it            did, the story would be different and will reflect reality a            bit better (not a lot because there are other ways of skewing            data such as filling it out on behalf of an organization,            robotic fillers and so on). coupled with the fact that web aim            went through a major controversy recently that damaged its            credibility somewhat, i would dare not trust web aim results            again.          this leads to my second point: quantity            versus quality. if nv access went straight for quantity alone,            they could have implemented all possible feature requests in            hopes of boosting market share. the reality in front of us            says otherwise: not all feature requests are here. numerous            factors contribute to this problem:             lack of              leading developers: in 2017, a long-time nvda developer              started working for another organization, and nv access has              been looking for his replacement ever since. even if the              replacement is found, it   ll take several months for him or              her to become used to this community, learn about              accessibility and how to interact with members, and earn our              trust (it took reef turner a year to fully earn our trust).              folks can counter this by saying that there are countless              contributors out there, but ultimately what gets into nvda              depends on pull requests and review time from nv access.    attitudes              about open-source software from organizations: as some folks              pointed out, there are prevailing attitudes about              open-source in organizations that makes it a bit harder for              nvda to land on their computers, which allows developers to              assess true needs of organizations through user feedback.              without valuable feedback from organizations (a quality one              at that), we won   t see huger progress in nvda development.    outside              attitudes about the nvda community: from the inside, nvda              community is seen as a tight nit of enthusiasts who strives              to make nvda better every day. on the outside, however, we              have a mixed bag of reputations, from admiration to              honorable mentions to disdain. every organization have these              mixed reputations, especially more so for a community              powered by technology such as linux kernel developers, web              browser vendors and web standards organizations, and even              screen reader community. not only we need to show that we              are united inside, we need to showcase unity outside of this              community.    inside              matters just as outside: public relations outside of nvda              community is important, but unity within an organization is              just as important as public organizational face (i   ll              address developer   s point of view below). what makes nvda              stand out is our unity despite coming from different              circumstances and backgrounds.             most of these point to quality, not            quantity alone. in summary, quantity is important, but quality            is just as important as how many people download nvda 2017.4            between christmas and new year.          lastly, in regards to organization            internals, i   d like to address something i really wanted to            say for the past few weeks: sometimes, i felt burnt out. my            initial response to your enthusiasm over my audio tutorials            was that i   ll ask for justifications for producing an updated            version, seeing that there are countless free videos and            tutorials out there. this was partly because i truly felt            burnt out with academics, speech and debate competitions and            what not (especially after a debate regarding a potential            feature held not long ago), at one point telling myself that            i   ll retire from the nvda community sooner than later and            feeling as though i carried important burdens on my shoulders.            but you didn   t see that justification post; instead, i posted            links to where you can download the 2018 version of my audio            tutorial series. in effect, i   ve given up my christmas            holidays for this community, knowing that i needed a time to            listen to you all and do something about it. all this was            possible because of a simple act of listening and thinking            about what the community means to me and what my work means to            everyone. i   m committed to finishing welcome to nvda 2018            series before nvda 2018.1 ships, with several addenda coming            after that, all because of support from this community and            outsiders. and i promise again: the welcome to nvda 2018            series was, and will remain, free for all. all i ask of you in            return is donate to a cause that makes equal access to            technology possible, especially during this holiday season and            beyond.          i   m sure for many of you, my musings above            are a bit hard to digest. now you know why i don   t trust web            aim survey results, quality is just as important as quantity,            and read a confession from a community leader on his inner            feelings. but there are two more things you need to know,            something all of us needs to think about:          community leaders won   t stay with you            forever. in early 2017, i sensed that a long-time nvda            developer would leave this community for something better.            only i and others didn   t know until summer that it would be            jamie moving onto mozilla foundation.          i also felt, back in early 2017, that my            active time with the nvda community is slowly drawing to a            close. i don   t know when it   ll happen, but i   ve been laying            foundations for the next generation of developers and            enthusiasts to take the lead. this is one of the reasons for            setting up the devlearning subgroup, because i felt it is time            for me and other leaders to teach nvda internals and other            concepts to the next group of community leaders and developers            so they can bring nvda to the next level and do more amazing            things than i and others did (in my case, for the past five            years).          lastly, i sense a time when this community            will face a sharp divide to a point where people will start            questioning the merits of this community. i only told a select            few earlier because it wasn   t right for me to disclose it            early and for them to prepare a plan. the screen shade debate            is, in fact, a sort of a preview of what is to come. one of            the fundamental questions you will face at that time will be            whether you still have your first love for nvda, and whether            you still have your original reasons for joining this            community. the survival of this community at that time will            depend on your ability to unite to face a difficult situation,            even if that means facing possible splits. one thing you            should not do at that time: ignoring new users and outside            critics, because they are influential opinion leaders and are            key stakeholders in nvda   s future. one thing you should do            though: listen to others and think critically.          hope this makes sense.    merry (early) christmas,    joseph

suggestions are   welcome.   i'll send it to the list in its final form for distribution by   whomever wants to do so.              the brief tutorial begins below my   signature.      gene              moving from window-eyes to nvda  a very short   tutorial telling you just what you need to know to do a lot of what               you did before.            many people are apprehensive about switching to   nvda or any other screen-reader             from window-eyes.   this tutorial will explain   and demonstrate that such             apprehensions are largely based on   misunderstandings.               before i discuss the misunderstanding that causes   most of this apprehension, i'll             briefly discuss installing nvda and changing the   synthesizer used and speech             parameters.            nvda has a talking installer.   run the file as   you would any installation file.               you may get a dialog asking if you want to run the   file.   use the command alt r             for run.   if you get a uac prompt, answer alt   y.     run narrator.   then run the nvda installer.     when you   run the installer, there will be a pause and then a bit of music will               play.   not long after, the talking installer   will run.   unload narrator at that             point.   return to the install dialog.  tab   through the dchoices.   accept the license agreement and then tab to   install.               you will get other options but install is the one   you want.  don't stop using nvda because of the voice.   a lot of people   don't try nvda because             of the voice.   as soon as you get it set up,   i'll tell you how to change the             synthesizer used.            after nvda is installed and running, it's time to   learn how to change the             synthesizer.     issue the command control   insert s.   use either insert.   from now on, assume you             can use either insert unless i state differently.     a synthesizer selection dialog will open.  you will see a list of   different possibly available synthesizers.   choose sapi 5.                 i know everyone has at least one sapi 5 voice on   their machine.   up and down arrow             through the list and stop on sapi five.   press   enter.  you will now hear another voice.   it may be the same voice you   hear in narrator.     now issue the command control insert v.   you are   now in the voice selection and adjustment dialog.     up and down arrow to   see what voices are available.   stop on the one you want.     now tab   through the dialog and change settings for the voice.     once you find a   voice you want and tab through and set whatever you want such as             speed and punctuation, press the ok button.                 now, let's continue with what i spoke of at the   start of this tutorial.   the             misunderstanding that makes the switch seem   daunting is that the user doesn't             realize that most of the commands he/she uses are   windows commands and program             commands and they won't change.            consider the following examples:  opening menus   was and still is alt.   that's a windows command to open menus in               programs.   it's the same no matter which   screen-reader you use.     control o for open doesn't change.   using   the arrow keys to move in a document             doesn't change.   tabbing through dialogs   doesn't change.   neither does how you move             in a list or a treeview or work with a combo box,   and the list goes on.     screen-reader commands, many of which may   change, such as read title bar, provide             access to information you can't get or can't get   conveniently by using windows or             program commands.   for example, read title   bar.   in window-eyes, the command is             control shift t.   in nvda, it's insert   t.   i am assuming throughout this tutorial             that you are using the default desktop layout in   nvda.   all commands are given in             that layout.   the title bar is something a   sighted person looks at.   you can't move             to it with the pc cursor or application cursor,   whatever you wish to call it,             because there is no need.   a sighted person   can just see it.   so the screen-reader             has a command, read title bar.   that command   is not a windows nor a program             command.            here are the screen-reader commands you will need   to know to allow you to do a lot             of what you did before.  read title bar, insert   t.     time, insert f12.     read current window, insert b.   in   window-eyes the command is control shift w.     read to end, insert down   arrow.   use the down arrow on the main keyboard.  stop speech with   control, as with screen-readers in general.     commands such as control   home, control end, control left and right arrow are             windows movement commands for moving in any   standard edit field including word             processor edit fields.   none of them will   change.  more screen-reader commands:  screen review commands:  note the   pattern as i give these commands:  read previous line, numpad 7.       read current line, numpad 8.  read next line numpad nine.  you move in   screen review to the previous or next line when you issue those             commands.   you can keep moving and reading   until you get to the top or bottom of             the screen.  read previous word, numpad   4.  read current word, numpad 5.  read next word, numpad 6.  read previous   character, numpad 1.  read current character, numpad 2.  read next   character, numpad 3.  note the pattern.   read current is the key in the   middle of each of these rows.  move to and read previous is the key on the   left.     move to and read next is the key to the right.  the lower the   numbers the smaller the movement unit.   1 2 and 3 move by character.                 4 5 and 6 move by word.   etc.  here are two   more important commands:  jump to top of window, shift numpad 7.  jump to   bottom of window is shift numpad 9.            i've said top and bottom of window but that's   oversimplified.   it depends what kind             of review mode you are using.   i won't go into   that to any extent in this very             short tutorial.     that is the one you   should be in usually.   unless you change it, you will remain             there.   if you use another review mode,   afterword, make sure you return to object             reviewif you don't, you won't hear what you expect   to hear at various times.     to make sure you are in object review, issue   the command numpad insert nummpad 1.               when you are already in object review and can't   move to another review mode, you             will hear no previous review mode.   you will   then know you are in the right one.               or if you are returning from another review mode,   when you hear object review, you             will know you are back in the right one.  i won't   describe its use here, but screen review is similar not in commands, but in               how you review the screen to the window-eyes   cursor.   object review is different             from any review mode available in   window-eyes.   it is valuable to know for various             uses.   depending on how you use your computer,   you may find it valuable or not.   i'm             simply making you aware that it is different and   that you may want to learn it.            i'll provide a resource that teaches in great   detail how to use nvda.  this tutorial is to get you going using nvda and to   show you that even with the             little i will teach, you can still do a good deal   of what you used to do.   you may             then learn more as you wish.            believe it or not, that is just about all i will   teach in this very short tutorial             but   i'll tell you a few more   things.  internet browsing:  when you are on a web page, quick navigation   commands are almost identical whether             you are using nvda or window-eyes.     move   by headings is h.   skip blocks of links is n.     move to next button   is b,     next combo box is c.  next check box is x.  nvda has an   input help mode which is similar to what is in window-eyes.   insert and               1 on the main keyboard turns it on.   when you   press a key or combination of keys             that might be a command, you will hear what the   keys are and what, if any command             they execute.   this varies cdepending on where   you are.  when in a browser that supports browse mode, typing a lot of   individual letters             will give you information about what the keys do in   browse mode.   i already gave             much of that information above but you may want to   press a lot of keys using input             mode in a browser.               to turn input mode off use the same command you   used to turn it on, insert 1.            to learn more about nvda, a popular tutorial is   available at (insert url.)     on that page, you will see links to   download different sections dealing with             different subjects.   you can also download the   entire tutorial as a zip file.            there is also an e-mail list for nvda users.     to join, send a blank message to this             address:   nvda+subscribe@nvda.groups.io             i hope that this tutorial has removed much of your   apprehension about switching to             nvda.   now, as you wish or need, you may   consult the tutorial i gave a link to.               nvda is a powerful screen-reader and it will meet a   lot of users needs as well as             jaws or window-eyes does.   i hope this very   short tutorial gives you a good             foundation on which to build confidence that the   transition should be much easier             than you may have thought and that it will help   make it much more enjoyable.

"405","a new member with some questions","""                 if something is in the ribbons, you shouldn't have   to use object navigation to get to it.   ribbons are, in essence, menus   organized differently.   i will include a tutorial i wrote on using   ribbons.   if you have difficulties finding things often or don't understand   how to work with ribbons, you may seriously want to consider using this short   tutorial.   it is below my signature.              gene              i'll provide a brief tutorial   based on what i wrote years ago of how to work with ribbons.                 i've added a little to it   here.              i don't know how the   organization of windows has changed in windows 10 but this description should   allow you to look through the windows ribbons, or any other ribbons, and see how   things are organized.                 first, i'll discuss a structure   found in later versions of windows that you need to know about-- the split   button.     one thing you will see as you look around ribbons and in other   places in windows are split buttons. a split button often allows you to see more   options than just the default action.   let's take an example.       let's say you come across a split button that says shut down windows.     if you press enter on that button, windows will shut down.   that is the   default action.   split buttons often show more options if you either right   arrow while on the button or down arrow.   as an example, if you are on the   shut down split button, you can right arrow and a list of options will   open.   the items in the list include sleep, hibernate, restart, and   others.   you up or down arrow through the list or use the short cut   commands you hear announced as you move through the list.   the letter   shortcuts often take actions without pressing enter so be careful when using   them, just as you are in menus.               so, let's review.   you find   a split button that says shut down.   if you press enter, the computer will   shut down. if you right arrow, other options may be displayed.   or if you   down arrow, other options may be displayed.   a split button won't work with   both methods.   one method, either right arrowing or down arrowing will do   so if it can be done with the button.   try both methods if you don't know   which one might work.   if you are on a tool bar which extends across the   screen from left to right, down arrowing will open additional options.   if   you think about this, it makes sense.   if you are in a menu, down arrowing   will move you to the next item in the menu.   so you right arrow on the   split button to cause it to display more options.   in a tool bar that   extends across the screen from left to right, right arrowing will move you to   the next item in the tool bar.   so you down arrow when on the split button   to cause it to display more options.   but some tool bars run up and down   the screen, as menus do.   and at times, you may not be sure which way a   structure extends on screen.   so, as i said, if you are not sure or don't   know, try both methods of causing the split button to display more   options.   often, one of them will work. if you open the options a split   button offers and don't want to work with them, arrow in the opposite direction   to move out of them.   for example, if you right arrowed to open more   options, left arrow.     some split buttons don't do anything when you   right arrow or down arrow.   in that case, open them with alt down   arrow.   then tab through the additional options.   i've almost never   worked in this way with split buttons but if you want to close a split button,   try alt up arrow if you've used alt down arrow to open it.            now, to ribbons   themselves.            regarding ribbons, much of the   complaining about them is not warranted if you understand how they work and how   to use short cut commands effectively and efficiently.   and i would   strongly recommend against using the jaws virtual menus, no matter what the jaws   training material says about ribbons being difficult to use.   the training   material is just plain wrong and using virtual menus, you will be unnecessarily   dependent on one screen-reader.   there are other disadvantages to using   them which i won't go into here.            try looking at ribbons and doing   what is described below in wordpad.   everyone with windows 7 has wordpad on   their machine.   wordpad provides a good environment to look at and practice   working with ribbons.                 the essence of working with   ribbons is this:  press alt to move to the upper ribbon.  you will probably   be on an item that says home tab. items on the upper ribbon are announced as   tabs such as home tab, view tab, etc.     to see what ribbons are   available, right or left arrow repeatedly to move through the ribbons.     move in one  direction to move through all of them, just as you would to move   through all the menus.             for this demonstration, just so   we are all doing the same thing, move with the right arrow. when you get back to   where you started, you can keep right arrowing to move through the items again,   if you wish.   you can move through all the items as many times as you want.   or you can move with the left arrow whenever you want to move in the opposite   direction.                 stop on view.   then start   tabbing.   you will move through all items in what is called the lower   ribbon that are in the view ribbon.               in other words you tab to see   the items in a ribbon once you move to it.   tab moves you forward through   the items, shift tab moves you backword.  so tab and shift tab are used   instead of up and down arrow.               many items in the lower ribbon   are buttons.   use either the space bar or enter to activate the button. you   may find a button that opens a menu and if you press enter or the space bar, you   will then be in a menu.             each time you move to an item,   you will hear the short cut command to work with that item.     but jaws   has a bug and you often won't.   to hear the short cut, use the command jaws   key tab.   if you are using the default jaws key, it is either   insert.            try tabbing to an item in a   wordpad ribbon and using the command insert tab.   you will hear some   extraneous information.   the last thing you will hear is the short cut   sequence.   you can repeat the information by repeating the command as often   as you want.            let's look at an item which is   usually called the application menu.   return to the main program window in   wordpad by closing the ribbons.   you can either press escape repeatedly, if   necessary, or you can press alt once.   now, open the ribbons again with   alt.     start right arrowing until you get to the application   menu.  you will hear application menu and then something like button drop down   grid.   never mind drop down grid.   it's a description you don't have   to worry about.   the important things are that you are on a button and at   the application menu.   press enter or the space bar to activate the   button.   activating the button opens the menu.   start down arrowing.   you will hear all the short cut commands necessary to open an item or take an   action.   when you got to the menu item, you heard alt f.   when you   open the menu and move through it, you will hear all the letters   announced.   for example, if you down arrow to save as, you will hear alt f   a.   that means that, when you are in the main program window, you open the   menu as you always did, alt f, then type a.   alt f opens the menau and a   then opens save as.   ribbon programs have one menu and you should look   through it.   many important and common commands and interfaces such as   options may be there.   by options, i mean the kind of options interface you   used to find in the tools menu.            now the we have seen the menu,   let's look at the ribbons structure some more.  to review, and add more   information, as you have seen, you can move to the ribbon interface with   alt.   then right and left arrow, just as you would move from menu to   menu.     you can also move to a ribbon using alt and a letter.   so,   alt h takes you to the home ribbon.   alt v takes you to the view ribbon,   etc.   once you are on the ribbon you want to work with, tab to move forward   through the items in a ribbon.   shift tab to move back through the   items.   so tab and shift tab are used instead of up and down   arrow.  ribbons are divided into categories which you will hear announced as   you tab.   for example, in an e-mail program, a ribbon may have a category   named respond.   you may hear this announced as respond tool bar.   as   you tab, you will hear commands such as reply and forward in the respond   category.   when you hear a category announced, don't tab until you hear   everything spoken.   you will miss the first command in the category if you   do.   i'm talking about working with an unfamiliar ribbon.     there   are often many more commands and items in a ribbon than in a menu.   so   memorize command sequences for items you know you will use regularly.       as i said, there are different categories in ribbons to help organize   items.   you can quickly jump from category to category in a ribbon to help   you see if there is a category you want to look through.     move to a   ribbon in wordpad.   for example, alt h for hhome or alt v for view.  then   repeatedly issue the command control right arrow to move forward from category   to category and control left arrow to move back.   when you get to a   category you want to hear the items in, start tabbing.   of course, you can   shift tab to move back.               open a ribbon in wordpad and tab   through it to see how it is organized by moving through it.     then use   control right arrow to move by category and tab to see what is in a   category.               commands such as control o,   control n, control s, control r, etc. are mostly retained in programs  that   use ribbons, though you won't hear them announced. if you don't already know   them, you'll have to find them in ways such as by looking at a list of keyboard   commands for the program.   such lists are often available in the help for   the program. if you already know the commands from having used an older version   of the program, most or perhaps even all of the commands you know will   work.

"438","a newcomer who is seemingly lost",""" could be anything from hardware to software.    its why when i get a problem like this, unless i need to try to peal back layers if its to deep i start from 0, and start writing notes.    first the issue, do tests see where things stand.    then its time to get dirty.    you can try this yourself, but the procedure is long.    in first place, go to device manager and see what your sound card is, you may have a corrupted driver, if its realtech you can search for that and just install that though be aware that the latest 2.82 release has a non working control panel so for those of us without the unlocked cards, luckily my desktops and laptops have unlocked cards so i don't need the control panel at all, but on my laptop i do maintain it just doesn't work and i will have to get the latest drivers from the makers.    that may work.    next, try to make another account in the users control panel, and if it works transfer all your documents and stuff over to it by coppying your documents, videos, pictures and music folders over plus any other folders you have in your user folder over that are not app folders like appdata, etc or any file in the root of that folder and delete the old account, should take you 30 minutes.    its possible this is all your having.    in which case, stop reading.    we can move on though.    next using firefox or internet explorer go to www.pcpitstop.com/betapit and do a test.    they really want you to buy software to fix your issue and they fail you on the internet buffers thing but its not important, you need to look at any other warnings you get, oh you can forget about fragmentation and caches and things like this.    don't bother with making an account you don't need it.    if there is any basic issue that should pop it up.    next, search for and get speedfan, and install it, there should be a menu or tab somewhere that talks about hard disks, select each internal drive you have and perform an online test and see if there are any problems.    completely unrelated but we need to check for everything, i have never checked temps of hardware but you could go into that later if you had to.    next get belarc adviser, you need this especially if its a desktop, get your mutherboard number well at least model and just type that in to google and get the mnufacturer of your box, search for drivers, bios, etc and where needed maybe with sight update as needed.    at this point you are probably about done, being updated should be done.    malware scan and antivirus scan if you want defrag and do chkdsks on the disk if you want.    clear your junk with disk cleanup.    all this is really basic,    next, check all your software you have, some of it may need updating, maybe you should uninstall jaws and see if it comes back and reinstall it again.    finally note down what software, runtimes, etc you have from your programs list and see what you need and do not need.    for me, thats windows, java, flash, shockwave, codec packs, drivers ofcause, windows ofcause, office if needed, gps software if needed, itunes icloud, google sync software if needed, runtimes for visual   studio and vb6, directx and my software i use,    that being cdbxp, goldwave, audacity, abby fine reader, adobe dc, nvda,supernova sr.    out of all that, the runtimes, the packs, java, all adobe software, ccleaner, 7zip, and cdbxp are standard features i load on everything.    every system i maintain has a subset of the programs with some of that huge list above.    but you may not remember what you have, some of it may be out dated, some not used, some you were doodling with, loads of issues and i think i left out my tts packages of which i have 2.    now, its time to get dirty.    i'd try to clean out your desktop if you can with compresser or something of dust maybe check your connections while at it.    next its time to get dirty.    if you get sighted help do a reset of your bios and check its all supposed to be ok i have had it where not all settings were saved after an update and that some settings do not always save right.    next, a full reformat and the system is ready to use.    now in steps at least for me, i do the following.    install windows, extra optional features if needed, runtimes, directx, slim dx, java, codec packs, software players like vlc, my reader nvda, ccleaner, 7zip and cdbxp.    install all addons i need.    install all updates i need.    then stop and look at my list.    install extras i need depending on the system.    test and run the system for a day with the stuff loaded.    load everything else you would usually use from your list, updating and testing as you go.    by now you should have your software loaded.    if in this step something screws up, note that down and restore the system to a time just before that run then keep going.    note you shouldn't have issues with this if its a basic package, i pole for basic non automatic updates every 6 months or so.    but if you have a problem at this point it means you may need an update, the issue is solved by updating the software or reporting the issue and getting a fix.    with my realtech issue i reported it to realtech, they havn't responded sadly but oh well. i tried.    the next is to see what else could be it, chances are you won't know till you do something along the line and it popps up.    have you checked your cabling, do other sounds play.    to be honest it sounds like the soundcard/user account issue i had in january with a system service.    in this scenario, the user had just managed to clear out an infection/ corruption on his server.    the issue was partly to do with a dead wireless card and security device which didn't work due to incompatability due to age.    as a result updates never updated right, things got in and drivers got corrupted.    i firstly reinstalled the corrupted drivers.    next, i made a new account which worked and transfered all the files to it then killed the old account and files.    meanwhile i was ordering a new wireless card and security device which came the next day.    i installed them and reports from the user not only have shown that things are working but that the performance is better.    in this scenario, i was able via device manager and via add remove programs were able to find the drivers were dammaged.    i also saw uncompleted updates, unfinnished scans and a lot of extra mangling consistant with a bad connection to the net.    a lot of the tools that should have protected things had simply shut down because they couldn't connect at all.    after cleaning part of the user account was dammaged.    a search on google for the ralink devices found them discontinued and the company gone.    i was able to source locally and quickly a d link wireless card and install it though sadly i got the wrong size but it works.    all in all a happy time.    but it may not be like this it rarely ever is.    then again that may exactly be the issue.    usually if an issue is so hard to solve over the phone i usually if local get the system to my address and look at it there.    9 times out a million i find the issue.    or it maybe a different issue unrelated and again i fix that issue.    i may simply not find an issue to fix or can't find an issue that i can solve myself.    or it maybe not on the system but infrastructure round it.    i have often come through this but often after looking for updates and updating things if it doesn't work, a full reformat and really slow rebuild finds outdated things non used modules and other things.    most of which i have, forgot to update or simply there are new versions out that fix the issue.    chances are that i never saw these so myself and others are out of date, and i can update as needed.    usually if its hardware i don't touch it though.

"517","a question about non destructive errors","""  hi brian,     without being specifically familiar with this particular code, a couple of points off the top of my head:      - often different programs (and sometimes even the same program) will have controls which may look and behaves exactly the same to the end user, but underneath they work differently.   this can be why some controls throw up errors when others do not.  - partly for the same reason, if we try and find out information a certain way and it fails, there may be another (backup, if you like) way that we can try which may get the same information.   in that case, the control may throw up an error, but appear to work as normal.  - my lack of familiarity with the code will show here, but the error about coinitialize not being called is likely because it would be usual to initialize that prior to making a certain request.   for whatever reason that wasn't done, which may in some situations mean that the value returned by that request may be unexpected.   whether that's a problem or not i'd need mick or jamie to answer, but all that might give you a bit of an idea to start with.   again, that's all just general off the top of my head and without being specifically familiar with the code.      regards      quentin.

"558","a question for users of multiple screenreaders.",""" hi all. over the years i've heard several of you say that multiple screen readers are a good thing, so much so that some have advocated keeping demo copies installed, just in case. so i have a question. can you give specific cases where this is useful?      i ask this because i started using nvda full time because i decided to try it for a month. during that time, i ran into one or two things where nvda didn't read text, i think installers and the like but i can't remember exactly, since it was like three or four years ago. i'd fire up jfw, and it would produce the exact same results. that demonstrated, to me at least, that i didn't get any real advantages out of running jaws.      now don't misunderstand me. i'm not trying to start a fight here. i'm not saying that jaws is bad or anything. i'm just saying that when i ran into potential issues with nvda, jaws didn't solve those issues either. since nvda was doing everything else i wanted, i concluded that switching wouldn't cause me to lose any access. so i'm curious to know what things you might gain access to with jaws or another screen reader that you can't get with nvda. i suppose the obvious example would be anything with jaws scripts, i don't know if things like dolphin have scripts or not. but i mean, i've just heard people advocate this, like i've said, you know have a demo copy installed and stuff like that. so i'd just like to hear of any specific cases where another screenreader has helped. i think it would be really useful to know that kind of thing.

"591","a question for users of multiple screenreaders.",""" multiple screen readers are not particularly useful, unless possibly you are a access technology trainer or assessor or someone who works in the industry. i guess one possible use case might be, your primary screen reader crashes. then you need sound so you can figure out why the screen reader crashed, so you pull up your secondary screen reader and find out. i think it's interesting that the people who subscribe to the multiple screen readers are better idea also subscribe to the business of vote the market for screen readers and access technologies being too small to keep the price point down. mastering multiple screen readers is outside the scope of time effort and expense that most people are willing to put in. even considering the diverse feature sets strengths and weaknesses of the various window screen access products, i think most people would be best served by picking one and learning it well.    best,    erik      on october 7, 2017 3:56:01 pm 'john isige' &lt;gwynn@...&gt; wrote:    hi all. over the years i've heard several of you say that multiple  screen readers are a good thing, so much so that some have advocated  keeping demo copies installed, just in case. so i have a question. can  you give specific cases where this is useful?      i ask this because i started using nvda full time because i decided to  try it for a month. during that time, i ran into one or two things where  nvda didn't read text, i think installers and the like but i can't  remember exactly, since it was like three or four years ago. i'd fire up  jfw, and it would produce the exact same results. that demonstrated, to  me at least, that i didn't get any real advantages out of running jaws.      now don't misunderstand me. i'm not trying to start a fight here. i'm  not saying that jaws is bad or anything. i'm just saying that when i ran  into potential issues with nvda, jaws didn't solve those issues either.  since nvda was doing everything else i wanted, i concluded that  switching wouldn't cause me to lose any access. so i'm curious to know  what things you might gain access to with jaws or another screen reader  that you can't get with nvda. i suppose the obvious example would be  anything with jaws scripts, i don't know if things like dolphin have  scripts or not. but i mean, i've just heard people advocate this, like  i've said, you know have a demo copy installed and stuff like that. so  i'd just like to hear of any specific cases where another screenreader  has helped. i think it would be really useful to know that kind of thing.

"651","a short overview of what s new changed and removed in nvda 2017.2","""          dear nvda community,      as some of you are testing nvda 2017.2 release candidate, i   d like to take a moment to give you an overview of things added, changed, and removed in the upcoming version. because entries in    what   s new    document might sound a bit technical for many, i decided to write a release notes style post, similar to notes for releases of other screen readers and products.      what   s new in nvda 2017.2      highlights: aria-current support, return of full audio ducking feature in windows 10 creators update, faster response in edge when navigating by line, ui automation support improvements, more unicode symbols added, some deprecated code removed.      aria-current  aria-current is a way to markup current step, page, time, date and others on a webpage. for example, when navigating some pages such as mobile facebook page, you may encounter phrases such as    current page    or    current time   . nvda can now detect and announce these attributes when you encounter them.      more unicode symbols added  nvda can now announce more unicode symbols such as fractions such as one-fifths, one-tenth and others.      significant improvements for edge  previously, if you were reading multilingual documents in edge and configured nvda to switch languages on the fly, nvda could not switch languages. this has been fixed. also, nvda will respond faster (up to three times faster) when navigating by line in edge. lastly, various improvements were added to support edge better in windows 10 creators update.      audio ducking makes a full return in windows 10 creators update  in nvda 2017.1, the    always duck    option was removed when using windows 10 creators update. this option is back in 2017.2.      deprecated code removed  various code included in earlier versions of nvda, such as speech.reason_ constants and deprecated configuration management functions were removed.      other enhancements   nvda will no longer prevent you from navigating to certain objects where shortcut keys were not defined.  two empty spaces are no longer added when displaying keyboard shortcuts for ui automation controls.  when issuing read current line command three times, the synthesizer in use will apply currently using language to read text, as well as use character descriptions for characters for certain languages.  windows calculator that ships with windows server 2016 and windows 10 enterprise ltsb are supported.  nvda will skip uia controls marked as layout when performing object navigation with simple review mode turned on.  menu items on various websites can be activated in browse mode.  various selection issues in browse mode were fixed, including an issue where select all would not work if the browse mode cursor is located on positions other than start of a page.  burmese is now a supported language, bringing translations to 51 languages.  added basic unit testing framework.       sneak preview of features under active testing  note that features below may change as time progresses, and are based on features being tested by alpha snapshot users.   windows onecore voices (windows 10 only): you can now use windows onecore (aka sapi mobile) voices directly from nvda without use of an add-on (listen to various nvdacon 2017 sessions for a sample).  search suggestion sounds (windows 10 and possibly other places): when you type text into edit fields that display search suggestions, you   ll hear a sound when suggestions appear. you can turn this off from object presentation dialog. this means you won   t need windows 10 app essentials add-on to use this functionality. listen to nvdacon 2017   s windows 10 and universal apps with screen readers session for more details (audio to be made available soon).  many other small improvements under the hood.       thanks.  cheers,  joseph     ""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"661","a short overview of what s new changed and removed in nvda 2017.2","""            exactly what does this mean that nvda will do? here's the text            when issuing read current line command three times, the        synthesizer in use will apply currently using language to read        text, as well as use character descriptions for characters for        certain languages.            el 23/05/2017 a las 02:59 a.m., joseph        lee escribi  :                    dear nvda community,          as some of you are testing nvda 2017.2            release candidate, i   d like to take a moment to give you an            overview of things added, changed, and removed in the upcoming            version. because entries in    what   s new    document might sound            a bit technical for many, i decided to write a release notes            style post, similar to notes for releases of other screen            readers and products.          what   s new in nvda 2017.2          highlights: aria-current support, return of            full audio ducking feature in windows 10 creators update,            faster response in edge when navigating by line, ui automation            support improvements, more unicode symbols added, some            deprecated code removed.          aria-current    aria-current is a way to markup current            step, page, time, date and others on a webpage. for example,            when navigating some pages such as mobile facebook page, you            may encounter phrases such as    current page    or    current            time   . nvda can now detect and announce these attributes when            you encounter them.          more unicode symbols added    nvda can now announce more unicode symbols            such as fractions such as one-fifths, one-tenth and others.          significant improvements for edge    previously, if you were reading            multilingual documents in edge and configured nvda to switch            languages on the fly, nvda could not switch languages. this            has been fixed. also, nvda will respond faster (up to three            times faster) when navigating by line in edge. lastly, various            improvements were added to support edge better in windows 10            creators update.          audio ducking makes a full return in            windows 10 creators update    in nvda 2017.1, the    always duck    option            was removed when using windows 10 creators update. this option            is back in 2017.2.          deprecated code removed    various code included in earlier versions            of nvda, such as speech.reason_ constants and deprecated            configuration management functions were removed.          other enhancements       nvda will no              longer prevent you from navigating to certain objects where              shortcut keys were not defined.    two empty              spaces are no longer added when displaying keyboard              shortcuts for ui automation controls.    when issuing              read current line command three times, the synthesizer in              use will apply currently using language to read text, as              well as use character descriptions for characters for              certain languages.    windows              calculator that ships with windows server 2016 and windows              10 enterprise ltsb are supported.    nvda will              skip uia controls marked as layout when performing object              navigation with simple review mode turned on.    menu items              on various websites can be activated in browse mode.    various              selection issues in browse mode were fixed, including an              issue where select all would not work if the browse mode              cursor is located on positions other than start of a page.    burmese is              now a supported language, bringing translations to 51              languages.    added basic              unit testing framework.             sneak preview of features under active            testing    note that features below may change as time            progresses, and are based on features being tested by alpha            snapshot users.       windows              onecore voices (windows 10 only): you can now use windows              onecore (aka sapi mobile) voices directly from nvda without              use of an add-on (listen to various nvdacon 2017 sessions              for a sample).    search              suggestion sounds (windows 10 and possibly other places):              when you type text into edit fields that display search              suggestions, you   ll hear a sound when suggestions appear.              you can turn this off from object presentation dialog. this              means you won   t need windows 10 app essentials add-on to use              this functionality. listen to nvdacon 2017   s windows 10 and              universal apps with screen readers session for more details              (audio to be made available soon).    many other              small improvements under the hood.             thanks.    cheers,    joseph

"700","a suggestion when helping people on the list.","""  now i'll be the contrarian and be so having followed the suggestion christopher is making at times and ignoring it others.   i'll expand this to both nvda and jaws, as the concept applies equally to both.  many new users have no idea of what the nvda key or jaws key is.   i know i certainly didn't and ended up having to ask when i first started hearing those terms used for 'the appropriate modifier key' based on user settings.  default settings on nvda and jaws are both to use desktop keyboard layout (unless there's some way they can detect a non-numberpad keyboard on a given laptop, and i've never tried installing on one to test that out and they're hard to find these days).   that means that in the vast majority of cases insert will be the nvda or jaws key.  those who switch to laptop keyboard layout are already a more sophisticated user than most beginning users are and can instantly translate 'insert+' to 'capslock+' when they see it.  the only time i personally 'get picky' about this is the odd situation where what follows the 'nvda key+' or 'jaws key+' happens to be different depending on whether one happens to be using a desktop versus a laptop keyboard layout.  the ability to understand that someone saying 'nvda key+'   or 'jaws key+' means either insert or capslock depends directly on pretty much having asked what's meant by 'nvda key' or 'jaws key.'   a basic skill when talking about screen reader commands, for any user, is the ability to mentally translate one expressed in desktop layout terms to laptop layout terms when necessary, and vice versa.  to me it's not that much different than requiring that someone who uses a screen reader be able to translate the common directions 'click,' 'right click,' and other mouse related commands that are given again and again and again in instructions not directly aimed at screen reader users into the necessary keystrokes for the screen reader and the keyboard on the machine they are personally using.  i didn't find the use of 'nvda key' or 'jaws key' at all useful when i was in my earliest days of working with screen readers and i suspect that many, if not most, neophytes won't, either.   you'd end up asking, 'what is the nvda key?,' which starts the whole explanation circle and basic education process.  --       brian                            the real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing        in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the      tempting moment.                        ~ dorothy nevill                  ""","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"706","a text tutorial on the mail people and calendar apps from david moore","""          hi all,  here, pasted right in this message, is a very understandable, easy to follow, and a step by step tutorial that i did on the win10 mail, people, and calendar apps.  please let me know if you have any questions as you do the steps that are in the tutorial.  here it is, pasted right below:  here is the start of the tutorial.  tutorial on the win10 mail, people, and calendar apps  by  david moore  all key commands for all three apps, mail, people, and calendar, are at the end of this tutorial.  intruduction:       i will let you know this first. when you import your email accounts into the win10 mail app,   your contacts are automatically imported into the people app. all calendar information, is imported into the calendar app.  so, if you want to work with your contacts, you have to do so in the people app and not the mail app. think of it like this. three apps work together to give you that ms outlook client experience.  the people app has all of your contacts. the mail app is where you work with and send your email messages. the calendar app has all of your appointments and much more.  now, while you are in the win10 mail app, you can switch to the calendar app or the people app.   many of the commands are the same as in wlm.   mail for windows 10 supports most types of email services.   you can add any of these microsoft accounts:  exchange, office 365, outlook.com, hotmail, live.com, and msn.com.   you can also add any of these accounts:  gmail, yahoo mail, icloud, or an account with a pop or imap server.      section one  launching the windows 10 mail app  so, let us consider how you can launch the mail app for the first time. the way i did it, was to press the windows key or ctrl+escape and type mail. i heard windows mail app trusted windows store app.  now, press enter, and the mail app will open. there you go, you have launched the mail app for the first time. the first time you open mail, you'll land on the welcome screen. press enter on get started. now, you are ready to start using the win10 mail app. if you have a microsoft account, your ms email account should already be imported into the mail app.      section two:  putting the mail, calendar, and people apps on your desktop, or pinning them to your taskbar:  finally, let us begin to learn how to use these three apps.  you may want to pin all three apps, mail, calendar, and people, to your taskbar, or put them on your desktop as short cuts.  to put them as short cuts on your desktop, press windows key+r to open the run dialog.  just type:  shell:appsfolder   in a second, all of your apps will be in a list. just press the first letter of the one you want until you hear, mail, for example.  now, press your applications key or shift+f10.  now, press the up arrow key once to hear:  create short cut.  enter on that, and you will hear:  short cut cannot be created here, do you want to put it on the desktop instead?  just press enter, and the mail app will be on your desktop.  to pen it to the taskbar, just press the windows key or ctrl+escape and type mail, for example.  when you hear mail, just press the appllications key or shift+f10 and arrow down to:  pin to taskbar and press enter.  the mail app will be on your taskbar.  you can do the same for the calendar and people apps.      section three  a few key commands to get started:   here are a few commands to use the mail app. tab key: the tab key will get you anywhere you need to go in the mail app. also, f6 will take you to different sections of the app. these three apps, mail, people, and calendar apps have been made so accessible, that you can use the pc cursor with jaws. also, no object navigation needs to be done in these three apps with nvda. narrator works great as well.  when you read messages with narrator, scan mode needs to be activated by pressing:  caps lock+spacebar.  that command toggles the scan mode on and off with narrator.  you only want to turn on scan mode to read messages.  you want it off the rest of the time. even when you type a message, scan mode needs to be turnned off.  scan mode is just for reading.  when a message is opened with jaws, you are put in a virtual viewer so you can use the virtual cursor, just like in a web page.  now, to work with messages:   to send your message, press  alt+s.  to reply to a message:  press ctrl+r.  to forward a message:  press ctrl+f.  to create a new message:  press ctrl+n.  as you type the email address, choices will populate to choose from.  to insert an attachment, press alt+i.  you can then brows for the file you want to attach.  all other key commands for all three of these apps, will be put at the end of this tutorial.      section four:  importing your first account into the mail app  now, let us add our first account.  from the list of messages for your ms account, tab to manage accounts and press enter.  if you do not have an ms email account imported in to the mail app, just tab to manage accounts and press enter.   next, tab to the add account button and press enter.   you will be in a list of account types you can add. in the choose an account dialog, use the down arrow key to go through the list of account types (outlook.com, exchange, google, yahoo mail, and so  on). when you hear the name of your account type, press enter. for example, if you want to add a gmail account, press enter on google. next, enter the email address for the account that you want to add. now, tab to the password box, and enter your password.  press the tab key to move to the sign in button and press enter.   now, press enter again on the:   done button.  your email account should import into the mail app in seconds, and your emails will be in your in box from the last three months.   now, if it does not work to import an account by choosing google, for example, any account will import into this choice:  go to the account choice:  other account, imap or pop.  any account, pop or imap, will import under this choice, even a google account.  only a few pop email accounts will have to be imported by hand with all of the settings.  for most accounts, your email and password will be enough to import the account.  the last account choice, is the advanced account. enter on this last choice if you need to enter in all of your account settings by hand.  the only reason why you need the advanced account choice is to import a few older pop 3 accounts and set them up by hand.  to import all of your accounts:  just follow the same instructions written above.  you will need to press enter on manage accounts, and enter on add account, for each account you import.  it is important that you know that your contacts for your accounts, are imported into the people app.  you can get to the people app right from the mail app.  also, all calendar data partaning to your accounts, is imported into the calendar app.  this is how all three apps work together to give you the entire email client experience.  after you add your accounts, notice in the manage accounts menu, you will see a choice to link accounts. this means, that you could have all messages from all of your accounts go into one inbox. i would not do this. each account should have its own inbox.  now, let us press enter on one of the accounts that you just added and see what happens.  if you press enter on one of your accounts, there is a choice to delete the account if you decide you do not want it in the mail app anymore.  also, if you press enter on the sync settings, you will see that your emails from three months ago will import. you can change this if you want.  also, you can change some settings about how the emails are synced in the mail app, but i would not mess with that at all.  now, just press escape to get out of that, and you will be back in your list of accounts. press escape to close the manage accounts pane.   we are all done with the manage accounts option.      section five:  navigating the maiol app with the tab key  now, we have all of our accounts imported intothe mail app.  make sure that you are on a folder list of messages for one of your accounts.  a list of messages will be our starting point, and we will begin to tab.  now i will tab.  i am on my list of emails for my ms outlook account.  tabbing:  i hear navigation button collapsed.  you want to press enter to hear:  navigation button expanded.  if you do not do this, you will not see everything in the mail app.  tab again, and you hear:  new mail button.  this is what you activate by pressing the key command:  ctrl+n  you do not need this button.  tab: and you hear:  manage accounts.  that is where we just were when you imported and customized all of your email accounts.  tab:  you will see a list of all of your accounts once you import them into the mail app.  if you press enter on an account, the in box of messages for that account will open and you are put in the inbox of messages.   now, we will tab from your list of accounts.  you have folders button.  sub section:  folders button.  when you press enter on folders button, there is a lot you can do in here.  in this sub section, we will talk about all you can do after you press enter on folders button.  press enter on folders button:  the first thing you will be on, is a virticle list of all of your folders for that email account.  you can just up and down arrow to the folder you want, and press enter.  you are then put right in the list of messages for that folder.  instead of pressing enter on a folder, if you tab once, you can press enter on:  create new folder  as soon as you press enter, you have to type in the name of the new folder.  this will create a new folder for that account.  this is all in the folders button.  press enter on folders button, again, if you are not still in that pane.  on your list of folders, you can arrow to a folder, and press:  applications key or shift+f10.  you can now down arrow through the following choices:  add to favorites button  pressing enter will put that folder on your favorites list of folders, so you do not have to keep coming into the folders button to find a folder.  next choice when pressing applications key:  , create new subfolder button  pressing enter on that choice, will allow you to create a sub folder under that main folder you arrowed to.  as soon as you press enter, you have to type in the name of the sub folder, and press enter.  the third choice:   rename button  the fourth choice:  delete button  pressing enter there wil delete the folder.  fifth choice:  move button  sixth choice:   empty folder button   seventh and last choice:  pin to start button   to review:  when you arrow to a folder, you can press:  applications key or shift+f10,  and you get a menu of seven choices listed above.  you can press enter on any of those choices to do the action that it says.  we are all done with the folders button.  now, make sure that you are on the folders button, and we will start tabbing again.  if you tab from the folders button,  you are on your list of favorite folders i mentioned.  you can just arrow down through this list of folders that you chose to be your favorite folders.  you do not have to enter on the folders button to get to these.  they are right here in a list.  i have my in box folder, sent folder, trash folder, and a saved folder that i created, in my favorites list.  i keep those four folders in that favorites list, so i do not have to keep pressing enter on the folders button to get to those folders.  i can just tab over to this list of four folders that i use the most.  pressing enter on one of those four folders will put me right in the list of messages for that folder.  you always get put right on the list of messages when you enter on any folder.  now, we will tab from this favorites list, and we get:  moore button.  this is the exact copy of the folders button lol!  forget the more button lol!  tab again:  switch to calendar button:  tab:  switch to people button:  pressing enter on one of those buttons, will open one of those apps.  you can have all three opened at the same time.  tab:  settings button:      sub section:  we have important stuff here, if we press enter on settings button, so this will be another sub section, like folders button.  settings button  press enter on settings button.  now, let us look at the settings in the mail app. there are some settings that you might want to change or work with in these groups of settings . the two groups of settings you should open are the reading and signature settings. do not mess with the other groups of settings.  reading settings  there are two choices you might want to change in this settings group.  you can check or uncheck carrot browsing.  i would leave carrot browsing unchecked in the reading settings group.  now, in this reading group, there is also a button that turns on and off conversation view.  you definitely want this button checked, because your messages will be grouped into their respective threads.  you can delete the entire thread if your messages are in conversation view.  press enter on the back button to close the reading group.  each group of settings has a back button you can press enter on to get out of that group, and you are taken back to the groups of settings.  signature settings group:  this is the only other group of settings where you need to do anything.  press enter on signature settings.  in here, you can add a signature, or check all accounts to have the same signature  if you check to have a signature, and press tab, there is a signature that is there by default.   it says:  sent from mail for windows 10.  if you want to create your own signature, check the signature, and over right that default signature to add your own signature you want to appear after every message that you send.   you can have different signatures for each account, or have the same signature for all accounts by checking all accounts.  if you want no signature, you can just press spacebar to uncheck the signature toggle.  press the back button, to get out of the signature settings group.  if you press:  escape  you are back on the settings button, where we were tabbing across the mail app.  that is pretty much all i would worry about in settings.  there are just a few more tabs, before we are back to the list of messages.  tab from settings button:  there is a search edit box.  if you type any name, or phrase, and so on in that search box,  it will narrow down the list of email messages that have that name or phrase in them.  this is a great way to find a particular message very quickly.  i use this a lot.  you can get right to that search box,  by pressing:  ctrl+e  you do not have to tab to that lol!  tab, and you have:  sync this view button.  if you press that, your messages will load more quickly, but they load quickly anyway for me, and i do not have to press enter on that:  sync this view button.  tab again, and you have:  enter selection mode button.  this is important.  when you press enter on that button, you are on your list of messages in that folder, but now, there is a difference.  there is now a check box before each message that you can press spacebar on to check that message. you can check as many messages as you want.  now, if you shift tab twice, you are back to where the:  enter sellection mode button was.  now, there is a check box there that says, select all, check box not checked.  you can press spacebar to check all of your messages. you have to tab twice to get back to the list of messages, but now, they are all checked.  after you check messages, you can press the:  applications key or shift+f10  and you will have the following choices:  archive, delete, move, and a few less important choices in that context menu.  if you press enter on delete, all messages that are selected will be deleted. if you press enter on move, your list of all folders come up, and you can move your selected messages to another folder.  just press enter on the folder, and the selected messages are moved to that folder.      section six:  working with your messages:  now, we can start working with with our email messages for what ever account you pick from the list of accounts. all the accounts will be in a virticle list, and you just press enter on what ever account you want to work with, and you will be placed in the inbox and the messages will load.   here we go lol!  let us arrow through the messages in the inbox and read some of our messages.  just enter on the message you want to open. to read messages with nvda, you must be in brows mode.  when you type a message, you must be in focus mode.  the only time you want to be in brows mode, is to read the messages. to attach a file to the message, for example, you want to be in focus mode with nvda.  with narrator, you want to be in scan mode to read messages.  to do everything else, even type a message, you need to turn off scan mode. narrator works very well with the mail app.   now, with jaws, you are put in a virtual environment just like on the internet. the virtual pc cursor, will allow you to select and copy information that is right in the message.  when you are done reading that message, just press escape to get out of the message and back to the list of messages  you do not have to do anything with jaws to do all that you want to do in the mail app, even type a message.   now, let me give you some important key commands right here.  tab gets you anywhere in the mail app you want to be. tabbing will get you to the list of your accounts, and the folders button, that you enter on to get a full list of folders for that account. when you are on the list of folders, tab to the more button and press enter to do more with your folders, like create a new folder. to create a sub folder for a particular folder tab to the more button again, and press enter. down arrow to creat a sub folder. and arrow to which folder you want to create the sub folder for and tab to create, and press enter. . now, you can type the name of the sub folder you want, and press enter. that is how you create a sub folder of a folder that is already there. when you are on a message in the list, you can press the applications key or shift+f10 and get choices of what you can do with that message. one of these choices is move. if you enter on move, you will get a list of folders you can move that message to. i created a folder called saved messages. so when i want to save a message, i just move the message to my saved messages folder. if you press delete, the message goes in the trash folder. to send a message, press ctrl+n. you are put in the to: edit box. just type in the email, tab to subject, and tab to write your message. to send a message, press alt+s, and you are back on the list of messages in your inbox. after you open a message and read it, you can reply to it by pressing ctrl+r. just type your message, and press alt+s to send your reply. you will be in the list of messages, and just press the delete key to delete that message. to forward a message, just press ctrl+f. to spell check your message before sending, just press f7.   tabs on the ribbon of the mail app:  here we go with the ribbon. when you are in a message, three tabs show up on the ribbon. just press the alt key to get to the ribbon. the first tab you will hear is the format tab. right arrow to the insert tab, and right arrow again to the third and last tab, the options tab. now, if you press alt a second time while you are still in the mail app, you will be on the tab that you were last working with. if you were working with the options tab lastly, the options tab will show up, and you will have to left arrow to get back to insert and format. you do wrap around in a circle with a couple of other choices in there as you wrap. on any of these tabs, just press the down arrow to get to all of the choices for that tab. then, press tab to tab through all of the choices. for example, to insert an attachment into an email, press the alt key, and arrow to the insert tab. then, press the down arrow, and you are right on the files choice. it will not say attach, this is very important. pressing down arrow on the insert tab, allows you to insert different things into your email. remember, you can just press:  alt+i to attach a file.   to attach anything else, you must go to the insert tab on the ribbon. the ribbon is not important, unless you want to insert different things into the email, or if you want to format the email.  other choices to insert, are table, link, and so on. these are different things that you can insert in your email. press enter on files, and you can brows your computer to find a file to insert or attach, and press enter on the open button. now, you are put back on your message you are composing. if you press shift+tab one time, you will be on your file that you attached to your email. that is how people will find your attachments. they will just shift tab to hear all of the files you inserted or attached to your email. now, use shift+tab again to move focus to the subject line, and press shift+tab again to hear the sender   s name. in other words, when you are in a message, press shift+tab to hear all of the information like the subject, the sender, the time and date, and so on. there are not key commands to read this information to you like in other clients. when you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return to the message list. that is the key. if you just press escape, you go back to your list of messages. if you press delete on a message in the list, it goes to the trash folder right away. now, if you select some text in your email, just press alt, and arrow to the format tab, and press down arrow to the format choices if you want to format your email. just tab through the choices. there are many, you can do about anything here to format your email text. for example, if you down arrow on the format tab, there will be choices to bold, underline, and to do other things to the text that you select in your email that you are composing. now, for the options tab, the third and last tab, you will not need to use, but feel free to check out the options. the option for spell checking, is the same as pressing f7 in your message. now, here is the thing about spell checking in the mail app. you can go to the win10 settings app, by pressing windows+i to have win10 correct much of your spelling as you type. this only works though, in a win10 app. the mail app qualifies for that. so, in settings, arrow to the devices group and press enter. then, go to the type choice and press enter. check two check boxes. the first says something like correct spelling, and the second one says something like high light words that are misspelled. check those two check boxes and press enter. now, when you are in the mail app, most of the words will be automatically corrected as you type them. however, this feature will not correct all misspelled words. this is where you press f7 to do a total spell check. important: there is not a way to have the mail app spell check every message automatically when you send it like with wlm. you definitely have to spell check every message that you compose before you send it just like with each document in word.   well, we have covered everything with the mail app itself.  now, i will show you quickly how to use the people app and calendar app, and then you can use all three apps together as one email client.  people app:  launch the people app, and tab a few times. you will tab by a new button, where you can manually enter the information for a new contact. if you tab passed the new button, you will come to a list of contacts. you cannot use first letter navigation to jump to a certain contact, but here is what you can do. tab one more time, and you will be in a list of letters of the alphabet. again, you cannot use first letter navigation, like you can now use in the all apps. just arrow down to the letter you want, and shift+tab back to the list of contact starting with that letter. find the name you want, and tab a few more times. there will be an edit where you can edit the contact's information. tab passed that, and you will come to profile. tab one more time, and you will be on their email. to copy that email, you have to press the applications key, or shift+f10, and press enter on copy. you will then have that person's email copied to the clip board. you can go to the mail app, and paste that into the to: edit box to send them an email. that is it with the people app. remember, your contacts are imported into the people app. as you type an email into the mail app, the populated choices come from the people app.  calendar app:  launch the calendar app, and press alt+ctrl+4 to get into month view. you are put on a grid of days of the week. you will land on to day. it will say the date as well. for example, you will hear friday, october 28. you also hear how many events are linked with that day, like birthday's of your contacts and so on. tab to each event, and press enter on the event to get the details of the event. if you shift+tab, you will go back to the day of those events. if you press right and left arrow, you will go forward a day or back a day. up arrow takes you a week before from that day, and downarrow takes you a week ahead of that day. if you want to schedule an event for a certain day, just press enter on that day, and a dialog will come up for you to enter all of the information for the appointment or event, and there is an okay or done button. there you go! that is how you read days, the events for those days, and how to schedule an event for that day. that is about it for the calendar app.      here are many keyboard shortcuts to use all three apps:   account manual sync (send and retrieve new mail)  ctrl+m  or  f9  mark as read  ctrl+q <p class=""""msono""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"708","a text tutorial on the mail people and calendar apps from david moore","""                       hello, it   s a good tutorial. thanks!           trimis din    mail  pentru windows 10              de la:   david moore      trimis:  miercuri, 16 august 2017 01:33     c  tre:   nvda@nvda.groups.io      subiect:   nvda  a text tutorial on the mail, people, and calendar apps from david moore                      hi all,    here, pasted right in this message, is a very understandable, easy to follow, and a step by step tutorial that i did on the win10 mail, people, and calendar apps.    please let me know if you have any questions as you do the steps that are in the tutorial.    here it is, pasted right below:    here is the start of the tutorial.    tutorial on the win10 mail, people, and calendar apps    by    david moore    all key commands for all three apps, mail, people, and calendar, are at the end of this tutorial.    intruduction:          i will let you know this first. when you import your email accounts into the win10 mail app,      your contacts are automatically imported into the people app. all calendar information, is imported into the calendar app.    so, if you want to work with your contacts, you have to do so in the people app and not the mail app. think of it like this. three apps work together to give you that ms outlook client experience.    the people app has all of your contacts. the mail app is where you work with and send your email messages. the calendar app has all of your appointments and much more.    now, while you are in the win10 mail app, you can switch to the calendar app or the people app.    many of the commands are the same as in wlm.     mail for windows 10 supports most types of email services.   you can add any of these microsoft accounts:    exchange, office 365, outlook.com, hotmail, live.com, and msn.com.   you can also add any of these accounts:    gmail, yahoo mail, icloud, or an account with a pop or imap server.          section one    launching the windows 10 mail app    so, let us consider how you can launch the mail app for the first time. the way i did it, was to press the windows key or ctrl+escape and type mail. i heard windows mail app trusted windows store app.    now, press enter, and the mail app will open. there you go, you have launched the mail app for the first time. the first time you open mail, you'll land on the welcome screen. press enter on get started. now, you are ready to start using   the win10 mail app. if you have a microsoft account, your ms email account should already be imported into the mail app.          section two:    putting the mail, calendar, and people apps on your desktop, or pinning them to your taskbar:    finally, let us begin to learn how to use these three apps.    you may want to pin all three apps, mail, calendar, and people, to your taskbar, or put them on your desktop as short cuts.    to put them as short cuts on your desktop, press windows key+r to open the run dialog.    just type:    shell:appsfolder     in a second, all of your apps will be in a list. just press the first letter of the one you want until you hear, mail, for example.    now, press your applications key or shift+f10.    now, press the up arrow key once to hear:    create short cut.    enter on that, and you will hear:    short cut cannot be created here, do you want to put it on the desktop instead?    just press enter, and the mail app will be on your desktop.    to pen it to the taskbar, just press the windows key or ctrl+escape and type mail, for example.    when you hear mail, just press the appllications key or shift+f10 and arrow down to:    pin to taskbar and press enter.    the mail app will be on your taskbar.    you can do the same for the calendar and people apps.          section three    a few key commands to get started:    here are a few commands to use the mail app. tab key: the tab key will get you anywhere you need to go in the mail app. also, f6 will take you to different sections of the app. these three apps, mail, people, and calendar apps have been   made so accessible, that you can use the pc cursor with jaws. also, no object navigation needs to be done in these three apps with nvda. narrator works great as well.    when you read messages with narrator, scan mode needs to be activated by pressing:    caps lock+spacebar.    that command toggles the scan mode on and off with narrator.    you only want to turn on scan mode to read messages.    you want it off the rest of the time. even when you type a message, scan mode needs to be turnned off.    scan mode is just for reading.    when a message is opened with jaws, you are put in a virtual viewer so you can use the virtual cursor, just like in a web page.    now, to work with messages:    to send your message, press    alt+s.    to reply to a message:    press ctrl+r.    to forward a message:    press ctrl+f.    to create a new message:    press ctrl+n.    as you type the email address, choices will populate to choose from.    to insert an attachment, press alt+i.    you can then brows for the file you want to attach.    all other key commands for all three of these apps, will be put at the end of this tutorial.          section four:    importing your first account into the mail app    now, let us add our first account.    from the list of messages for your ms account, tab to manage accounts and press enter.    if you do not have an ms email account imported in to the mail app, just tab to manage accounts and press enter.    next, tab to the add account button and press enter.    you will be in a list of account types you can add. in the choose an account dialog, use the down arrow key to go through the list of account types (outlook.com, exchange, google, yahoo mail, and so    on). when you hear the name of your account type, press enter. for example, if you want to add a gmail account, press enter on google. next, enter the email address for the account that you want to add. now, tab to the password box, and   enter your password.    press the tab key to move to the sign in button and press enter.    now, press enter again on the:    done button.    your email account should import into the mail app in seconds, and your emails will be in your in box from the last three months.    now, if it does not work to import an account by choosing google, for example, any account will import into this choice:    go to the account choice:    other account, imap or pop.    any account, pop or imap, will import under this choice, even a google account.    only a few pop email accounts will have to be imported by hand with all of the settings.    for most accounts, your email and password will be enough to import the account.    the last account choice, is the advanced account. enter on this last choice if you need to enter in all of your account settings by hand.    the only reason why you need the advanced account choice is to import a few older pop 3 accounts and set them up by hand.    to import all of your accounts:    just follow the same instructions written above.    you will need to press enter on manage accounts, and enter on add account, for each account you import.    it is important that you know that your contacts for your accounts, are imported into the people app.    you can get to the people app right from the mail app.    also, all calendar data partaning to your accounts, is imported into the calendar app.    this is how all three apps work together to give you the entire email client experience.    after you add your accounts, notice in the manage accounts menu, you will see a choice to link accounts. this means, that you could have all messages from all of your accounts go into one inbox. i would not do this. each account should   have its own inbox.    now, let us press enter on one of the accounts that you just added and see what happens.    if you press enter on one of your accounts, there is a choice to delete the account if you decide you do not want it in the mail app anymore.    also, if you press enter on the sync settings, you will see that your emails from three months ago will import. you can change this if you want.    also, you can change some settings about how the emails are synced in the mail app, but i would not mess with that at all.    now, just press escape to get out of that, and you will be back in your list of accounts. press escape to close the manage accounts pane.      we are all done with the manage accounts option.          section five:    navigating the maiol app with the tab key    now, we have all of our accounts imported intothe mail app.    make sure that you are on a folder list of messages for one of your accounts.    a list of messages will be our starting point, and we will begin to tab.    now i will tab.    i am on my list of emails for my ms outlook account.    tabbing:    i hear navigation button collapsed.    you want to press enter to hear:    navigation button expanded.    if you do not do this, you will not see everything in the mail app.    tab again, and you hear:    new mail button.    this is what you activate by pressing the key command:    ctrl+n    you do not need this button.    tab: and you hear:    manage accounts.    that is where we just were when you imported and customized all of your email accounts.    tab:    you will see a list of all of your accounts once you import them into the mail app.    if you press enter on an account, the in box of messages for that account will open and you are put in the inbox of messages.    now, we will tab from your list of accounts.    you have folders button.    sub section:    folders button.    when you press enter on folders button, there is a lot you can do in here.    in this sub section, we will talk about all you can do after you press enter on folders button.    press enter on folders button:    the first thing you will be on, is a virticle list of all of your folders for that email account.    you can just up and down arrow to the folder you want, and press enter.    you are then put right in the list of messages for that folder.    instead of pressing enter on a folder, if you tab once, you can press enter on:    create new folder    as soon as you press enter, you have to type in the name of the new folder.    this will create a new folder for that account.    this is all in the folders button.    press enter on folders button, again, if you are not still in that pane.    on your list of folders, you can arrow to a folder, and press:    applications key or shift+f10.    you can now down arrow through the following choices:    add to favorites button    pressing enter will put that folder on your favorites list of folders, so you do not have to keep coming into the folders button to find a folder.    next choice when pressing applications key:    , create new subfolder button    pressing enter on that choice, will allow you to create a sub folder under that main folder you arrowed to.    as soon as you press enter, you have to type in the name of the sub folder, and press enter.    the third choice:    rename button    the fourth choice:    delete button    pressing enter there wil delete the folder.    fifth choice:    move button    sixth choice:    empty folder button     seventh and last choice:    pin to start button     to review:    when you arrow to a folder, you can press:    applications key or shift+f10,    and you get a menu of seven choices listed above.    you can press enter on any of those choices to do the action that it says.    we are all done with the folders button.    now, make sure that you are on the folders button, and we will start tabbing again.    if you tab from the folders button,    you are on your list of favorite folders i mentioned.    you can just arrow down through this list of folders that you chose to be your favorite folders.    you do not have to enter on the folders button to get to these.    they are right here in a list.    i have my in box folder, sent folder, trash folder, and a saved folder that i created, in my favorites list.    i keep those four folders in that favorites list, so i do not have to keep pressing enter on the folders button to get to those folders.    i can just tab over to this list of four folders that i use the most.    pressing enter on one of those four folders will put me right in the list of messages for that folder.    you always get put right on the list of messages when you enter on any folder.    now, we will tab from this favorites list, and we get:    moore button.    this is the exact copy of the folders button lol!    forget the more button lol!    tab again:    switch to calendar button:    tab:    switch to people button:    pressing enter on one of those buttons, will open one of those apps.    you can have all three opened at the same time.    tab:    settings button:          sub section:    we have important stuff here, if we press enter on settings button, so this will be another sub section, like folders button.    settings button    press enter on settings button.    now, let us look at the settings in the mail app. there are some settings that you might want to change or work with in these groups of settings . the two groups of settings you should open are the reading and signature settings. do not   mess with the other groups of settings.    reading settings    there are two choices you might want to change in this settings group.    you can check or uncheck carrot browsing.    i would leave carrot browsing unchecked in the reading settings group.    now, in this reading group, there is also a button that turns on and off conversation view.    you definitely want this button checked, because your messages will be grouped into their respective threads.    you can delete the entire thread if your messages are in conversation view.    press enter on the back button to close the reading group.    each group of settings has a back button you can press enter on to get out of that group, and you are taken back to the groups of settings.    signature settings group:    this is the only other group of settings where you need to do anything.    press enter on signature settings.    in here, you can add a signature, or check all accounts to have the same signature    if you check to have a signature, and press tab, there is a signature that is there by default.    it says:    sent from mail for windows 10.    if you want to create your own signature, check the signature, and over right that default signature to add your own signature you want to appear after every message that you send.    you can have different signatures for each account, or have the same signature for all accounts by checking all accounts.    if you want no signature, you can just press spacebar to uncheck the signature toggle.    press the back button, to get out of the signature settings group.    if you press:    escape    you are back on the settings button, where we were tabbing across the mail app.    that is pretty much all i would worry about in settings.    there are just a few more tabs, before we are back to the list of messages.    tab from settings button:    there is a search edit box.    if you type any name, or phrase, and so on in that search box,    it will narrow down the list of email messages that have that name or phrase in them.    this is a great way to find a particular message very quickly.    i use this a lot.    you can get right to that search box,    by pressing:    ctrl+e    you do not have to tab to that lol!    tab, and you have:    sync this view button.    if you press that, your messages will load more quickly, but they load quickly anyway for me, and i do not have to press enter on that:    sync this view button.    tab again, and you have:    enter selection mode button.    this is important.    when you press enter on that button, you are on your list of messages in that folder, but now, there is a difference.    there is now a check box before each message that you can press spacebar on to check that message. you can check as many messages as you want.    now, if you shift tab twice, you are back to where the:    enter sellection mode button was.    now, there is a check box there that says, select all, check box not checked.    you can press spacebar to check all of your messages. you have to tab twice to get back to the list of messages, but now, they are all checked.    after you check messages, you can press the:    applications key or shift+f10    and you will have the following choices:    archive, delete, move, and a few less important choices in that context menu.    if you press enter on delete, all messages that are selected will be deleted. if you press enter on move, your list of all folders come up, and you can move your selected messages to another folder.    just press enter on the folder, and the selected messages are moved to that folder.          section six:    working with your messages:    now, we can start working with with our email messages for what ever account you pick from the list of accounts. all the accounts will be in a virticle list, and you just press enter on what ever account you want to work with, and you will   be placed in the inbox and the messages will load.     here we go lol!    let us arrow through the messages in the inbox and read some of our messages.    just enter on the message you want to open. to read messages with nvda, you must be in brows mode.    when you type a message, you must be in focus mode.    the only time you want to be in brows mode, is to read the messages. to attach a file to the message, for example, you want to be in focus mode with nvda.    with narrator, you want to be in scan mode to read messages.    to do everything else, even type a message, you need to turn off scan mode. narrator works very well with the mail app.    now, with jaws, you are put in a virtual environment just like on the internet. the virtual pc cursor, will allow you to select and copy information that is right in the message.    when you are done reading that message, just press escape to get out of the message and back to the list of messages    you do not have to do anything with jaws to do all that you want to do in the mail app, even type a message.    now, let me give you some important key commands right here.    tab gets you anywhere in the mail app you want to be. tabbing will get you to the list of your accounts, and the folders button, that you enter on to get a full list of folders for that account. when you are on the list of folders, tab   to the more button and press enter to do more with your folders, like create a new folder. to create a sub folder for a particular folder tab to the more button again, and press enter. down arrow to creat a sub folder. and arrow to which folder you want to   create the sub folder for and tab to create, and press enter. . now, you can type the name of the sub folder you want, and press enter. that is how you create a sub folder of a folder that is already there. when you are on a message in the list, you can press   the applications key or shift+f10 and get choices of what you can do with that message. one of these choices is move. if you enter on move, you will get a list of folders you can move that message to. i created a folder called saved messages. so when i want   to save a message, i just move the message to my saved messages folder. if you press delete, the message goes in the trash folder. to send a message, press ctrl+n. you are put in the to: edit box. just type in the email, tab to subject, and tab to write your   message. to send a message, press alt+s, and you are back on the list of messages in your inbox. after you open a message and read it, you can reply to it by pressing ctrl+r. just type your message, and press alt+s to send your reply. you will be in the list   of messages, and just press the delete key to delete that message. to forward a message, just press ctrl+f. to spell check your message before sending, just press f7.      tabs on the ribbon of the mail app:    here we go with the ribbon. when you are in a message, three tabs show up on the ribbon. just press the alt key to get to the ribbon. the first tab you will hear is the format tab. right arrow to the insert tab, and right arrow again to   the third and last tab, the options tab. now, if you press alt a second time while you are still in the mail app, you will be on the tab that you were last working with. if you were working with the options tab lastly, the options tab will show up, and you   will have to left arrow to get back to insert and format. you do wrap around in a circle with a couple of other choices in there as you wrap. on any of these tabs, just press the down arrow to get to all of the choices for that tab. then, press tab to tab   through all of the choices. for example, to insert an attachment into an email, press the alt key, and arrow to the insert tab. then, press the down arrow, and you are right on the files choice. it will not say attach, this is very important. pressing down   arrow on the insert tab, allows you to insert different things into your email. remember, you can just press:    alt+i to attach a file.    to attach anything else, you must go to the insert tab on the ribbon. the ribbon is not important, unless you want to insert different things into the email, or if you want to format the email.    other choices to insert, are table, link, and so on. these are different things that you can insert in your email. press enter on files, and you can brows your computer to find a file to insert or attach, and press enter on the open button.   now, you are put back on your message you are composing. if you press shift+tab one time, you will be on your file that you attached to your email. that is how people will find your attachments. they will just shift tab to hear all of the files you inserted   or attached to your email. now, use shift+tab again to move focus to the subject line, and press shift+tab again to hear the sender   s name. in other words, when you are in a message, press shift+tab to hear all of the information like the subject, the sender,   the time and date, and so on. there are not key commands to read this information to you like in other clients. when you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return to the message list. that is the key. if you just press escape, you go back   to your list of messages. if you press delete on a message in the list, it goes to the trash folder right away. now, if you select some text in your email, just press alt, and arrow to the format tab, and press down arrow to the format choices if you want   to format your email. just tab through the choices. there are many, you can do about anything here to format your email text. for example, if you down arrow on the format tab, there will be choices to bold, underline, and to do other things to the text that   you select in your email that you are composing. now, for the options tab, the third and last tab, you will not need to use, but feel free to check out the options. the option for spell checking, is the same as pressing f7 in your message. now, here is the   thing about spell checking in the mail app. you can go to the win10 settings app, by pressing windows+i to have win10 correct much of your spelling as you type. this only works though, in a win10 app. the mail app qualifies for that. so, in settings, arrow   to the devices group and press enter. then, go to the type choice and press enter. check two check boxes. the first says something like correct spelling, and the second one says something like high light words that are misspelled. check those two check boxes   and press enter. now, when you are in the mail app, most of the words will be automatically corrected as you type them. however, this feature will not correct all misspelled words. this is where you press f7 to do a total spell check. important: there is not   a way to have the mail app spell check every message automatically when you send it like with wlm. you definitely have to spell check every message that you compose before you send it just like with each document in word.      well, we have covered everything with the mail app itself.    now, i will show you quickly how to use the people app and calendar app, and then you can use all three apps together as one email client.    people app:    launch the people app, and tab a few times. you will tab by a new button, where you can manually enter the information for a new contact. if you tab passed the new button, you will come to a list of contacts. you cannot use first letter   navigation to jump to a certain contact, but here is what you can do. tab one more time, and you will be in a list of letters of the alphabet. again, you cannot use first letter navigation, like you can now use in the all apps. just arrow down to the letter   you want, and shift+tab back to the list of contact starting with that letter. find the name you want, and tab a few more times. there will be an edit where you can edit the contact's information. tab passed that, and you will come to profile. tab one more   time, and you will be on their email. to copy that email, you have to press the applications key, or shift+f10, and press enter on copy. you will then have that person's email copied to the clip board. you can go to the mail app, and paste that into the to:   edit box to send them an email. that is it with the people app. remember, your contacts are imported into the people app. as you type an email into the mail app, the populated choices come from the people app.   <p

                 process like cpu etc but eventually you will reach the                  next process     &gt;&gt;                  down. continue down through the list to get to where you                  want to go.    &gt;&gt;

                 something wrong in this version.    &gt;&gt;                  i'm using windows 10 (newest version) and nvda2017.4    &gt;&gt;                  from the moment i'm running 7.40 of skype, and someone                  is calling me, i    &gt;&gt;                  hear skype ringing, that is as usual.    &gt;&gt;                  but when i accepted the call, skype keeps ringing, also                  when i've ended    &gt;&gt;                  the call, skype keeps ringing until i've stoped skype in                  the taskmanager    &gt;&gt;                  or i've reboot my computer.    &gt;&gt;                  what i wrote before, it was a long time ago possible to                  use the    &gt;&gt;                  taskmager but now i only hear list, list, list.    &gt;&gt;                  there is nothing i can do else than reboot my computer.    &gt;&gt;                  that is very annoing    &gt;&gt;                  is there a possibillity to use the taskmanager again or                  ofcaurse a    &gt;&gt;

"1096","about taskmanager",""" you know brian thats what i have been driving at.    who cares about the windows interface, maybe you buy the core and a default skin then get others.    what is wrong with windows xp interface, nothing.    no search box but whatever.    win7 searchbox is nice, maybe i get that, but the rest well.    win7 is not that bad.    now win10 interface is not all bad, i mean the main desktop right now is fine, and i must admit those shortcut keys are nice.    the searchboxes all over the place i could do with out and all the universal apps, some are really good but i have no problem with classic skype and classic desktop apps.    you are right about the hardware.    because of the intel foul up, systems are slower, i have old systems some first gen which ran reasonably right but are now really bad.    i have certain boxes that will just not run right anymore.    as for skins, i don't mind if i can buy skins or even use certain elements, i want the win7 skin the xp skin, and maybe the windows 9x classic skins.    and if then we are going to skins, what if you could run windows skins on a linux kernal, yeah you would have to pay to run windows on linux but then i'd do it.    100-200   bucks for everything or 10-30 bucks a skin, gladly would i part with my cash.    then we wouldn't have this issue.    more rich sound themes including ambient sound for different places.    same could be for visuals i guess.    and some way to switch interfaces ofcause.    then windows would be a truely universal os.    but yeah win10 is not one big crashing crap pile.    but its not that tidy from all the recovery partitions it creates, to the fact things seem to be added every little while and they call it progress.    the fact that sometimes this means drivers suddenly just don't work anymore and i have to install them.    to all sorts of things.    on the last update of windows, the graphics card didn't work, and wehn i got it working and checked the program with my hp it found the update for that.    still things didn't work a check of the site told me i was misssing a lot but what about all the boxes that just don't get updates anymore, eventually the new boxes will not get updates then we have an issue.    to be honest i am all for an addition of windows that you got, you setup, and you could opt out of ever getting feature updates at all but then would have to get the latest update, something like firefox esr.    right now you can in some additions do this and stop all together updates for various things but if you do once the time expires you are pritty much locked out of updating, till you manually update, reformat, or get some help.    then again i never understood that feature.    at any rate in the end you would have no choice.

vda directory, replacing the file that was already there with the   newly modified version. i was asked if i wanted to use automatic elevated   priveledges to complete this task, and i said ok. the file was copied over   successfully.              14. i restarted nvda.              15. i pressed nvda+ctrl+s to select synthesizer, and   went to accappella tts. on my end this loaded the ella voice, which   is  fine, as she's exactly who i want to do this with.              15. i opened a blank file in notepad, and in it, i   typed:              #laugh01#              i tried this all the way up to 05, and it did   absolutely no good. all she says is, number laugh 0 1   number.              i tried putting a space after this line of text, no   good. i even tried a carriage return, but that didn't work either. no other text   was on the same line. the whole document was totally empty except for   this.              16. i tried              #cough05#              i wanted to make her cough as hard as she could, so i   could really really hear it in case it was suttle. that didn't work. all i heard   was number cough 05 number.              17. i also tried with      #cry05#              no good.              i dono what on earth i did wrong!              i know some voices don't have all the sounds nor   exclamations recorded, but unless i read it wrong, it looks like ella should   have all the above sounds included. i should note that the syntax of how i am   writing these things in notepad on a line all by themselves is: number sign,   then in all caps, the sound name, like cough, for example, c o u g h, then no   space after the letter h, 05, then another number sign.              i've tried putting a space after the first number   sign before the letter c in cough. no good. i tried putting a space after the 5   in cough05, no good. i've put a space before the numbers 05, no good. i put a   space on both sides, before the c, and after the 5 both. no good. i even did a   space before the c, after the h, and after the 5 all 3. no good. basically, long   story short, i tried every combination under the fortunate sun!              i'm totally sure the voices are activated, and these   voices are on version 1.49. i've tried all 5 levels of laugh, cough, cry,   sneeze, breath, and even have tried car revving. i even tried all 5 of aargh. no   good.              have tried with ella, will, will happy, rosey,   amilio, josh, and i think even heather. i also tried with mika.              i'm totally at a loss! i even did the sloppy work   around by adding the actual number sign symbol to the temporary dictionary, and   replacing with nothing more than a space character, then, setting the radio   button cluster to anywhere. that didn't do it either. that got rid of it saying   number, but now, all i get is               cry05              and that's it. no boo hoo hoo, no ha ha ha, no   aaaaaaaaarg! nothing.              i have some txt files of things i've written, and i   really, really, really! would like to get these things working, as i think it   would make reading the files really awesome, if i could get those codes to   work.              if anyone's gotten this to work, then tell me step by   step what to do. i have a backup copy of nvda that i can revert back to if you'd   like me to just start over totally fresh from before i ever started screwing   with this, this way we're at ground square 1.              the more specific keystroke by keystroke you can be   at telling me how to do this, the better. please, be as specific as you can be.   trust me. the extral verbiage will not drive me crazy. right now, i think i'm   gonna need it.              again, windows 10 home 64 bit, accappella tts for   nvda v 1.49, and nvda 2016.4 official release.              thank you profusely!              chris.

"1311","accessible antivirus",""" sadly i do think some of those malware makers have gotten greedy.  its why i like msse or a bare bones no frills you get what you see kind of deal.  from avg that seems to collect info to sell to others that load extras so they can send adds at you, to software, slowing your system like norton, to extras you neither want or need.  there is the accessibility issues to mind you to.  worse are the false alarms.  i have had programs, in one case games that the system had been using for ages but were suddenly malware.  i have heard horror stories with people's screen readers being classified as viruses and all double extention files being classified as viruses.  while thats generally not a problem if you need to use these  for say file conversion it can get messy.  the worst one is when bits of windows itself, and or drivers became false alarms.  i have heard stories that people had to reformat because of their security software.  msse is not that though it did detect a bunch of games as viruses.  it leaves me alone till there is a virus and then it tells me.  after several issues with one of the users on one of the boxes with 10 on, i am seriously thinking about using sophos home.  the main reason ofcause is that its supposed to be full cloud protection and as long as the system is connected i in theory should be able to access the configs from the website which seems accessible enough.  it seems to be no frills.  i am just waiting for win10 next release before i decide.  on the other hand, i may continue using msse, once 7 goes, i will have to go to 10 which uses defender which is supposed to be ok but does sadly have crazy notifications from  time to time.  its going to an app is making me think about the switch though since i will have to handle it on 2 units not under my sophos plan i may or may not just get used to that.  the 2 systems mine and another workstation that use 7 are at least 6 years old or even 7 in the old server's case.  and part of me wants to wait till those die.  msse is not the best, and as long as sophos doesn't get greedy it may be a contender.  i was going to get vipre lifetime till i heard that you can only activate it once and if you reformat or the hardware fails you need to buy another licence for the machine in question which defeats the purpose of even having a licence for it in the first place may as well use msse.  and no, even if it was that good, i am not going to crack it simply because the way those that make vipre with comments on their lifetime licence kind of goes against the grain.  it was why i eventually switched to 7zip.  winzip required me to buy an entirely new licence every time i got a new version.  i thought bother that rather crack it its the way to go.  but when 7zip came along i was like go away and don't ever come back!  if sophos doesn't have unwanted software and doesn't go greedy then i just may push for it.  its a pitty they don't have a home pro or small business version for lifetime use else i'd buy that.  fact is after experiences with avira, avg 9, norton, and mcaffee when msse came along i was about ready to just remove all antivirus software.  avast was also out of the question with capchas in it and other junk.  my thrust of using a barebones is i want it to find viruses and kill them, i want it to tell me in case the file is false and i can easily report or exclude it and report it to the right place.  i do not want slowed down systems, inaccessible interfaces, unwanted software, spying or other things for no reason.  the government spies on us to watch out for bad guys and to make sure we are safe.  i have accepted to that.  but i don't really want hastles.  i also want whatever it is to be long term and not short term like a year or 2 before it dies which was what was happening.  msse has maintained most of what i want   bar its protection but it appears the latest defender is starting to chuck eronious messages and with one of my parents randomly clicking things while thinking they are something else i am looking at sophos again.  as long as its easy to remove devices when they die or if i have to change or replace things when they are needed thats fine.

something        like a point of sale system, where the same screen is up for hours        upon hours.   eventually, you'll get what they now refer to as        pixel burn, and some pixels on the screen will literally burn        out.   after that, you'll see (albeit a very small one) a gap in        the screen at the location of the burned out pixel.   it's actually        rather common in

lead to dead pixels too, so it's not        always a result of image burn, but just to be fair to modern        manufacturers, it is way less prevalent than it used to be,        especially with the old crt monitors.                on 11/30/2016 11:08 pm, j harrington        wrote:                       this is my understanding as well that current monitors              are way less susceptible

fan of                doing that.          the technology in modern screens might be a bit                vulnerable to this 'easy way out'.          whenever you leave your computer unattended for a while,                the picture of the screen will be statically staying                unaltered. this means that all the tiny lightening dots -                what is named pixels - on the screen will be in a static                position. each pixel has a certain lifetime, and the                longer you leave it turned on, the faster it will outburn.                in the end, your screen will develop 'dead' spots, which                will render it useless for sighted people.          the text that stays on the screen for such excessive                periods of time, might also end up being 'burned' into the                screen material. that is to say, the shaddow of it will                stay on the screen, even when the picture is altered.                nothing that happens for a day or two, but over time, and                again something that will disturb the screen appearance                for sighted persons.          lastly, turning off the screen saver altogether, will do                exactly the opposite of what the initial user was looking                for. think of it this way.    the user wanted a way to save battery.         the screen uses power to lighten all pixels needed for                showing a picture.    leaving the screen always on, by turning off the screen                saver, will definitely drain the battery. the screen then                will use power to keep the current picture frozen.          choosing a blank screen saver, on the other hand, means                the screen is forced to show an empty page. that is, it is                going to turn each and every pixel off, way across the                whole screen. lights that are turned off, do not consume                any power. light that is turned off, cannot be outburned.                it saves battery power, and it saves the screen's                lifetime.          then, what about a standard screen saver?    it typically will show a picture, that every so often                changes. some tend to scroll across the screen, others are                more like a live movie showing some kind of nature, acting                characters, or a burning fireplace. even, some make a live                camera picture come up, whenever they are not using the                screen. for instance, you could have a wireless camera                installed in the trees in your garden, and whenever you                are not using the computer, it will display a live picture                of the birds feeding their chicks out in the nest,                realtime.          sum of it all, the screen saver's main mission is, to                have the screen permanently altering. namely to save the                pixels from staying static, namely to prevent the screen                from outburning. a screen saver consequently does consume                power, and not very little either. turning it off, still                means the screen is showing a picture. choosing a blank                screen saver, will mean the screen goes blank, and is by                far the most effecient way to save both battery and screen                lifetime.          hope this clears things up a bit.        david                          on 11/30/2016 9:21 pm, gene wrote:              i meant to say just turn the

like an external hard disk -                  i am ready to say the usb ports may not give you much                  for power saving. again, if you have something that                  draws a lot from the ports, learn to disconnect it,                  whenever you do not need it for a prolonged time.          turning off wireless and bluetooth? sure, that might                  give you a few minutes more on run-time, but cannot tell                  exactly how much. it would depend on how much you use                  the wireless, and how good coverage you have, where you                  are at any given moment. poor coverage, will demand the                  computer to resend information over the net, multiple                  times, and thereby consume some power.               in the old days, we used to turn off the screen, when                  there was no sighted people around. the screen is a                  power-consumer, hence if you can have it turned off, or                  at least lower the light on it, that might lengthen your                  battery life. on modern computers, it is not all that                  easy. old models used to have a slider, to turn up and                  down the brightness of the screen. turning it all down,                  meant the screen in practical terms was turned off. on                  modern models though, you will typically have to go to                  the control panel of windows, and turn it on or off.                  someone, on another list, suggested a while ago, that                  you could connect an empty monitor cable to the external                  screen connector on your laptop. to what extend that                  would help, in making the computer think it is on an                  external screen, therefore turning off the internal                  display - i am not able to tell for sure.          one thing though, that you could do, and which                  definitely will reduce power-consumption, is to change                  your hard disk to an ssd. the ssd has no mechanical                  parts, hence far less power is needed to operate it.                  less power, no mechanics, you have a much cooler run of                  the computer. that in turn, results in the fan spinning                  far less. less power consumption for the disk, less                  power consumption for the fan; it all amounts into quite                  a boost on your battery life.          i recently did the upgrade on my laptop. before, with a                  standard hard disk installed, it would keep just about                  2.5 hours on one charge. now, with the ssd installed, i                  can run the computer more like 4 hours before it tells                  me it is hungry for some recharge. add to it the faster                  computer i have got from it all, besides the far less                  noise i experience. and, of course, it is nice to not be                  cooked just because you happen to have your laptop in                  your lap.          as for general battery saving, i do suggest that you go                  to the control panel of windows. here, under power                  management, put your screen, disk and other equipment,                  into idle mode fast as you find it convenient. a screen                  that stays on for a whole hour, even if there is no                  activity, certainly will draw a lot of unnecessary                  power. shorten the on-time, to something like 10 or 15                  minutes. also, use a blank screen saver. if you do go                  for any screen saver that shows a picture, they are by                  definition constructed the way that the screen is being                  updated every so often. such updating definitely eats                  battery power, for absolutely no good reason, since you                  won't have any enjoyment of the picture scrolling across                  the screen anyway. besides, many screen savers do                  trouble the screen readers.          hope any of this will bring you a tiny step further.        david                            on 11/30/2016 8:27 pm, gene wrote:              those with more technical knowledge may agree or                    disagree with the

     believe either disconnecting or turning off usb                    devices if they can be turned off, would save more                    power.   using efficient headphones or amplified                    external speakers and keeping your play sound levels                    low would probably save more power.   taken together,                    such things might save enough power to amount to                    something.          if battery life is significantly insufficient, i                    doubt anything will give you a lot more time.   those                    with experience

"1827","accessible version of seamonkey?",""" hi.    i just went and installed seamonkey from scratch here, it's been a long time since i used it since i always use thunderbird portable. ensure that you're downloading from:   http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/     i'm using jaws at present, but seamonkey is very similar to thunderbird and thus rather screen reader friendly for the most part. i'm writing this with it, and this is my first message so hopefully it works. the version i have is 2.39. i wonder if there could be an add-on or interface setting that has made it go all wonky. did you try redownloading it, are you sure you're downloading from the official site, which appears to be that which i linked above?    worse come to worse, thunderbird will do most everything seamonkey does with no necessity to relearn anything, it is almost exactly the same just no web browser built right in. but i think you can fix it by uninstalling seamonkey and perhaps deleting your settings folder for seamonkey so it starts from scratch.  press windows key+r, type %appdata% and press enter. when the folder opens, find mozilla and open it. now find seamonkey and delete that puppy. btw, don't hold me responsible if that breaks something else even though it wouldn't make sense for it to do so. of course, i'd recommend uninstalling seamonkey then deleting that after uninstallation, then reinstall, hopefully if it is a setting that's the problem the setting in question is not stored in the registry?    good luck and enjoy setting that all up from scratch again! and yes, don't forget about thunderbird. i've been using it for years, it doesn't seem like it should be too awfully hard a call to switch to that given how similar they are. granted, i would submit that it shouldn't be necessary, seamonkey should work fine, definitely is for me.    lisa p geibel wrote: ""","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Elaboration","undefined"

"1959","accessing text boxes in microsoft word","""  hi pranav,     firstly, the ideal solution here (even using jaws to be honest), is to convince people not to use text boxes.      nvda doesn't currently have a direct keystroke, it's something we could look into.     for now, though, there are still a couple of ways of reading text boxes currently:      if the text boxes are positioned 'in line with text', they can be found within the text of the document.     currently they are identified as 'slash' though that's something we're working on.      once you are in a text box (or picture or other object) you can press tab to move between them.     you can add a text box into a document by pressing alt+n, x, enter then press escape once (so you are out of the text itself but the text box is still selected), then you can press tab to move between the objects in the document (this wraps so if you press tab on the last object in the document it will jump back to the first object).     be sure to either delete the text box you added or not save changes to this document!      you can also use the accessibility checker, which is handy for finding things but i'll warn you it's not the most direct route:     in word 2016 you can get to this from the 'tell me what you want to do' edit box by pressing alt+q and typing 'check', but from 2013 (or from 2016) you can press alt+f (file menu), then i (info tab), then i (inspect document) then down arrow to check accessibility.     this opens the check accessibility task pane but unfortunately puts the focus back in your document so you need to press f6.     this shows any accessibility issues, so if you down arrow through the details it will say 'warning' then 'objects not inline', then 'text box 2' (not sure why, they all seem to be called text box 2?).     press enter on that text box and press shift+f6 to jump back to your document with the text box selected (this works the same as the previous method of adding a new text box but without changing your document.     it is more cumbersome though, i'll not deny that!).      kind regards      quentin.

"1965","accessing text on web pages","""                 quick navigation keys such as move by heading h or   skip blocks of links, n, can often move you to the start or near the start of   the main text.   if you experiment on web pages, you will find which of the   two works well most often   also, at times, you need to do something like   use n to move to the first text that is more than just a few words or a   line.   you may then have to use it again because there may be, after a   little text, a number of links to like it or recommend it on various social   media platforms.                 also, the find command, one of the most underused   and underappreciated commands, is useful on pages where neither h nor n works   well.   the title of the web page, is usually repeated just about where the   main text begins.   if you want to check the title, read the title bar, and   then do a search for a word or two in the title bar.   for example, if a   title says,      president trump meets with republican house   leaders, searching for something like trump meets will get you to the title that   is about where the text begins.              i don't know how useful working with things like   landmarks are.   i started using the internet long before such features and   i never learned about them or used them.   and those who are excessively   dependent on them, to the extent that they don't know how to use methods   effectively such as i described, are then dependent on the kindness of strangers   to add such features as land marks to the site.   many sites have them but i   expect that a lot don't.   in my opinion, teaching how to use such features   should only be done after the person learning demonstrates competence in using   techniques such as i discuss.                 gene      gene  ----- original message   -----     ""","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","Answer","undefined","undefined","undefined"

burggraaf  &gt;&gt;&gt; sent: wednesday, march 08, 2017 9:04 am  &gt;&gt;&gt; to: nvda@nvda.groups.io  &gt;&gt;&gt; subject: re:  nvda  can i still get it for free  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; gene,   here is my reasonable take on this based on my more than 15 years  &gt;&gt;&gt; of  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; in depth experience not only of windows, but also other major operating  &gt;&gt;&gt; systems.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; first, windows is a terrible product in any itteration.   there isn't a  &gt;&gt;&gt; single thing windows does better than other operating systems except for  &gt;&gt;&gt; arketecture support.   it's the most expensive operating system to  &gt;&gt;&gt; implement  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; if you remove hardware from the equation.   windows supports cheeper  &gt;&gt;&gt; hardware  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; than the competition but that doesn't negate the fact that windows itself  &gt;&gt;&gt; is  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; the highest priced operating system on the market.   windows is also more  &gt;&gt;&gt; expensive to maintain.   in fact, an upgrade from windows seven to windows  &gt;&gt;&gt; 10  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; takes about two hours time.   if you have to fully patch windows seven sp1  &gt;&gt;&gt; it  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; takes between 3 and 6 hours depending on connection speed.   if you're  &gt;&gt;&gt; paying  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; by the hour, which would you choose?  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; windows is the least secure of all the major os, further compounding the  &gt;&gt;&gt; astronomical maintanence cost and driving down productivity.   i have not  &gt;&gt;&gt; yet  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; had to hack windows 10, but i have windows seven.   in windows seven it is  &gt;&gt;&gt; common place for programs to allow themselves transparently through built  &gt;&gt;&gt; in  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; firewalling.   it is also common place for programs to run as  &gt;&gt;&gt; administrator  &gt;&gt;&gt; without requiring the administrator account to be enabled or requiring an  &gt;&gt;&gt; administrator password.   it is possible for programs to sircomvent the  &gt;&gt;&gt; notification system that works on the front line, and it's even possible  &gt;&gt;&gt; and  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; considered advisable by many people to turn the security notifications  &gt;&gt;&gt; off  &gt;&gt;&gt; altogether.   in fact, it is possible when sitting at the keyboard of a  &gt;&gt;&gt; windows seven workstation to gain administrator access without logging in  &gt;&gt;&gt; at  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; all, to add, remove, or rename windows system files, to take command line  &gt;&gt;&gt; control of a workstation, and to perform any command line function  &gt;&gt;&gt; including  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; enabling or disabling the administrator account and changing account  &gt;&gt;&gt; credentials, all without logging in.   litterally any improvement would be  &gt;&gt;&gt; better than the attrocity that is windows seven security.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; microsoft interface design is terrible.   ribbons and tiles are only two  &gt;&gt;&gt; examples of design choices meant to set windows apart from competetors  &gt;&gt;&gt; but  &gt;&gt;&gt; had the effect of alienating users.   windows 10 does the smart thing and  &gt;&gt;&gt; returns the windows interface to a more desktop feel.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; windows only gets a refresh every three years or so.   that means a lot  &gt;&gt;&gt; happens in the computer world between releases.   because the releases are  &gt;&gt;&gt; alternately pretty decent over all come terrible to the point of  &gt;&gt;&gt; uselessness, windows appeals to pundets who don't like change and want to  &gt;&gt;&gt; hault progress.   fine, but windows seven is coming up on 8 years old and  &gt;&gt;&gt; we  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; are still talking about support for windows xp being discontinued.  &gt;&gt;&gt; nowhere  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; else in the world of operating systems are we talking about support for 8  &gt;&gt;&gt; year old software, and 17 year old software isn't even available for  &gt;&gt;&gt; download on pirate sites.   computers that shipped with windows 7 at the  &gt;&gt;&gt; time  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; of the release of windows 8 are now end of lifed, and yet, i was still  &gt;&gt;&gt; able  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; to buy and install a windows seven a month ago.   the cost to developers  &gt;&gt;&gt; of  &gt;&gt;&gt; supporting four operating systems spanning 11 years: ten, eight, seven  &gt;&gt;&gt; and  &gt;&gt;&gt; vista, is astronomical, and you lucky end-user, get to pay the bill.   the  &gt;&gt;&gt; cost of windows software over all is significantly higher than on any  &gt;&gt;&gt; other  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; operating system, and part of the reason is that windows users live in  &gt;&gt;&gt; the  &gt;&gt;&gt; past more than any other userbase.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; windows ten continues to be a free upgrade for current users of seven and  &gt;&gt;&gt; eight, long after it was supposed to switch to a completely paid product.  &gt;&gt;&gt; the minimum and recommended hardware configurations are similar to those  &gt;&gt;&gt; of  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; windows seven.   upgrading usually brings better plug and play hardware  &gt;&gt;&gt; support and other items under the hood that users would miss if they were  &gt;&gt;&gt; gone.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; there are features i like in windows ten such as it's minimalist email  &gt;&gt;&gt; app  &gt;&gt;&gt; and it's improved tts voices.   then there are things i'm not too pleased  &gt;&gt;&gt; with such as the loss of control over windows update and the increased  &gt;&gt;&gt; relience on ribbons.   true, we don't really have enough information about  &gt;&gt;&gt; this particular case to make a recommendation one way or the other, but  &gt;&gt;&gt; in  &gt;&gt;&gt; general, it is more than time to leave windows seven behind unlesss you  &gt;&gt;&gt; have  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; some substantial reason not to, such as loss of support for a crutial  &gt;&gt;&gt; piece  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; of hardware.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; all upgrades on all systems require a bit of retraining for new features  &gt;&gt;&gt; or  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; fernature that moves, but that is part and parcel of computing.   windows  &gt;&gt;&gt; ten  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; is market tested, reliable and functional at this point.   staying with  &gt;&gt;&gt; windows seven just because is fine for now if that's your personal  &gt;&gt;&gt; choice,  &gt;&gt;&gt; but if you're supporting or recommending on a pro or semipro basis, the  &gt;&gt;&gt; recommendation has to be to upgrade at this point unless circomstances  &gt;&gt;&gt; dictate otherwise.  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; best,  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; erik  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; sent with aquamail for android  &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.aqua-mail.com  &gt;&gt;&gt;

have  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; reasons to upgrade from windows 7 and microsoft has recently claimed that  &gt;&gt;&gt; for security reasons, you should upgrade because windows 7 is not secure  &gt;&gt;&gt; enough anymore because it isn't a new enough operating system to  &gt;&gt;&gt; incorporate  &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; newer security features.   i haven't seen any independent discussion  &gt;&gt;&gt;

don't just upgrade.   while many upgrades from windows 7 go well, you  &gt;&gt;&gt; can't  &gt;&gt;&gt; assume they will.   i don't think it   s a good idea to urge upgrading as a  &gt;&gt;&gt; general practice.   why is an upgrade being considered?   what features, if  &gt;&gt;&gt;

vda directory, replacing the file that was already there with the newly modified version. i was asked if i wanted to use automatic elevated priveledges to complete this task, and i said ok. the file was copied over successfully.        14. i restarted nvda.        15. i pressed nvda+ctrl+s to select synthesizer, and went to accappella tts. on my end this loaded the ella voice, which is  fine, as she's exactly who i want to do this with.        15. i opened a blank file in notepad, and in it, i typed:        #laugh01#        i tried this all the way up to 05, and it did absolutely no good. all she says is, number laugh 0 1   number.        i tried putting a space after this line of text, no good. i even tried a carriage return, but that didn't work either. no other text was on the same line. the whole document was totally empty except for this.        16. i tried        #cough05#        i wanted to make her cough as hard as she could, so i could really really hear it in case it was suttle. that didn't work. all i heard was number cough 05 number.        17. i also tried with    #cry05#        no good.        i dono what on earth i did wrong!        i know some voices don't have all the sounds nor exclamations recorded, but unless i read it wrong, it looks like ella should have all the above sounds included. i should note that the syntax of how i am writing these things in notepad on a line all by themselves is: number sign, then in all caps, the sound name, like cough, for example, c o u g h, then no space after the letter h, 05, then another number sign.        i've tried putting a space after the first number sign before the letter c in cough. no good. i tried putting a space after the 5 in cough05, no good. i've put a space before the numbers 05, no good. i put a space on both sides, before the c, and after the 5 both. no good. i even did a space before the c, after the h, and after the 5 all 3. no good. basically, long story short, i tried every combination under the fortunate sun!        i'm totally sure the voices are activated, and these voices are on version 1.49. i've tried all 5 levels of laugh, cough, cry, sneeze, breath, and even have tried car revving. i even tried all 5 of aargh. no good.        have tried with ella, will, will happy, rosey, amilio, josh, and i think even heather. i also tried with mika.        i'm totally at a loss! i even did the sloppy work around by adding the actual number sign symbol to the temporary dictionary, and replacing with nothing more than a space character, then, setting the radio button cluster to anywhere. that didn't do it either. that got rid of it saying number, but now, all i get is         cry05        and that's it. no boo hoo hoo, no ha ha ha, no aaaaaaaaarg! nothing.        i have some txt files of things i've written, and i really, really, really! would like to get these things working, as i think it would make reading the files really awesome, if i could get those codes to work.        if anyone's gotten this to work, then tell me step by step what to do. i have a backup copy of nvda that i can revert back to if you'd like me to just start over totally fresh from before i ever started screwing with this, this way we're at ground square 1.        the more specific keystroke by keystroke you can be at telling me how to do this, the better. please, be as specific as you can be. trust me. the extral verbiage will not drive me crazy. right now, i think i'm gonna need it.        again, windows 10 home 64 bit, accappella tts for nvda v 1.49, and nvda 2016.4 official release.        thank you profusely!        chris.

"2324","adobe digital",""" several reasons.    first, it allows me to use my browser of choice, regardless of platform, which means it doesn't matter if i'm on windows, sx, linux, freebsd, or even dos, (admittedly, i don't use dos very often), so it's a truly crossplatform solution.    second, i've never found an epub reader i liked.    it's a lot easier for me to change a number in the address bar of my browser to move through the pages/chapters than it is to hunt around on some inaccessible interface, trying to find the previous and next links.    of course, this goes back to the whole i've never found an epub reader i like.   most of the ones i've tried were completely inaccessible, and those that worked didn't work the way i thought they should.   i actually wrote my own epub reader (based on a slimmed down version of a web browser on osx), but that code doesn't translate to windows, linux bsd or other operating systems, so that solution remains only on osx.    now, my solution of using a browser doesn't work with encrypted epub format, and for those you'll have to use some dedicated drm capable epub reader.   i tend to avoid drm whenever possible, and if drm is absolutely 100 percent unavoidable, i generally choose kindle format, since the kindle reader on the iphone is completely accessible and usable.   failing that, i opt for pdf, because it's possible to solve that problem easier than other formats.   but, mainly the reason i read epub books with my browser is because it's the fastest and simplest method for me, and it's cross platform, which is important to me.   as i said, your mileage may vary.   most folks don't care about whether their epub reader works on multiple platforms, and even more folks aren't even aware it's possible to read epub books with anything except 1 or 2 programs, and personally, i'm all about choice.   i think the more options someone has to accomplish something, the better off said person is.   so, by letting folks know that epub is (generally) just html files that work just fine in your browser, i offer another solution for folks to read epub formats for themselves if something happens and their current method stops working.

"2327","adobe digital",""" the zip file is simply a collection of all of the files in the epub format, (usually in multiple directories), one of those directories is the actual book content, and it's name varies depending on what epub creater was used to make the book, but it's usually relatively easy to find, (just look for the directory that has multiple xml/html files).   simply enter that directory, and select any file you like, they're usually named with chapter numbers at the end of their name, though some of the names are a mile long for obscure reasons nobody but the epub creater knows, so wading through all that to get to the actual numbers at the end is sometimes a chore.   i have actually written both unix shell scripts, and windows batch files to rename these files to just their chapter numbers, because i don't need all the artifacts relating to creation, since i'm not actually using their prebuilt table of contents, so names don't need to match for me.    but in any case, after the files are named properly, it's simple enough to click on the 0000 or 0001 file, then to move to the next one, i just change the address in my browser, which is usually as simple as pressing control-l, pressing end, then backspace, then the new number, then press enter.   very fast and simple.   again, for folks who like their guis (i am not one of those people), you might want to stick to the epub reader you're using now, but i find having complete access to the book via web browser suits my purposes just fine.

"2353","adobe flash player with nvda",""" jolene,    i am very interested in your topic as i am currently writing a tutorial for users of the borrowbox digital library service in which adobe flash comes in to playing a preview of an audio book. i can forward my recent discussion on this and the solution to it if that would be of interest?    there is a good deal of discussion between nvda technical team  members on getting nvda to work with the embedded objects in adobe flash.   these are known as windowless objects and jaws, for instance cannot see them at all in firefox but can see them but has difficulty keeping focus on them in internet explorer.    nvda gets around this by labelling the embedded oject as unavailable and using the nvda+numpad divide (to move the mouse pointer to the current navigator object) followed by  numpad divide on its own which emulates a left mouse clikc.     i wonder if you could try this solution and see if it gives you access to the player?    i have tried your two links with nvda and firefox on windows 10 (all latest versions) and found the following:  kitv:   http://www.kitv.com/category/305776/live-stream   this stream started playing and sounding in the speakers as soon as i opened the link in firefox.    khon2:   http://khon2.com/live-stream/   this link did not start and a typical part of the screen showed this:    ' search the site  live stream'    then nvda said:   iframe 'embedded object unavailable' and then 'out of iframe' after i pressed down-arrow once.  the stream did not start playing automatically like the first one.  however, i pressed nvda+numpad divide and then numpad divide alone and it did start to play. another numpad divide stopped it. while nvda is reporting the embedded object, the screen is reporting 'blank' under the active cursor.     with these work-around techniques , both streams are working on what appears to be a similar system configuration to yours.     what do you think?    all the best,    cearbhall    m +353 (0)833323487 ph: _353 (0)1-2864623 e: cearbhall.omeadhra@...        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  i use the free version of spam reader to get rid of spam. the professional version doesn't have this disclaimer in outgoing emails.   try spam reader ( http://www.spam-reader.com ) for free now!

a page open you navigate to the omnibar (the address bar)          and type a search. when you press alt enter it opens what you          just searched for in a new tab without you having to close your          current web page.            needless to say i am a chrome convert.            it also works extremely well with my   mindspace  client, far          better than firefox did when i tried it last (about a month          ago). mindspace involves lots of multilayered sounds and lots of          dynamic page creation with javascript which chrome's v8          javascript engine handles with ease, far faster than firefox's          spidermonkey i think it's called.            while the above was of course a shameless plug, if you do          decide to have a look at mindspace please

figuring out when downloads are finished or when a page                  is refreshing itself, ie you normally hear the ticks   in                  the old version due to navigational sounds.    until i find a browser with this                  function of sound i'm loathe to get a new browser over                  ff52, but the problem is that i've been reading that                  some sites now do not support the old versions of                  firefox and tell you so when you have things like modal                  windows whatever they are.    on xp to make firefox perform even                  reasonably you need to use a version 45, as after this                  the actual load up times are hugely slowed, my guess is                  that the code is made for multi processor   devices, not                  single core ones.this is also why on xp you might find                  that chrome and firefox are similar in page loading                  times.          things are no pushing ahead so fast                  on sites that its not uncommon to see the message you                  browser is unsupported get this or that then you can                  come back.    to me this is a weird thing for                  commercial sites to do, as they are, in effect pushing                  away potential customers, but hey, that is their                  business.    brian

like it much more now                i may have sent messages in the past                  in which i expressed a much stronger liking for firefox                  than chrome.   at this point, i've changed my mind and,                  unless things change over time, as they may as firefox                  continues to implement its new internal technical                  changes, i consider chrome to be superior for general                  browsing. i haven't tested it for uses such as streaming                  or rss or other uses.   i will therefore only address                  general browsing and the interface.   others may want to                  comment on other aspects i haven't compared.          this is a long message, a bit of a                  review and a bit of discussion of the interface.   i hope                  those interested in the subject find it useful.          if you try chrome and find it                  superior for general browsing, you may still not want to                  use chrome as your main browser.   there are various                  considerations.   i'll explain why i changed my mind and                  what you may want to consider.   you may have other or                  different considerations as well.          the reason i say chrome is better for                  general browsing is because it loads pages faster than                  firefox.   you may want to compare and see if the                  difference is important to you.   there is a very                  noticeable difference.   i hadn't compared chrome with                  firefox for speed on a fast machine.   i compared them on                  a slow machine running xp perhaps six or eight months                  ago.   i had expected that, if chrome was faster, there                  would have been a noticeable difference, even though the                  machine was slow.   but there wasn't a difference that                  amounted to anything.          i recently decided to compare on a                  reasonably fast machine running windows 7 since many                  people have said on lists i'm on that chrome is faster.                    there is a very noticeable difference in speed on my                  windows 7 machine.   i don't know what the results would                  have been on a fast xp machine.          i haven't used chrome much but the                  increase in speed is the reason i say it's better for                  general browsing.          the chrome interface is different                  than firefox or internet explorer.   it isn't difficult                  to learn but it is different.   you will likely want a                  tutorial or some instructional material.   if you are                  good at learning by exploring, you may not want or need                  such material, at least not to use in depth, but you may                  benefit in early learning by using material.          the main things to know in terms of                  the differences in the interface are that chrome shows                  many things as web pages, such as settings and history                  and there is one menu, which you can open with alt f,                  that is, hold alt and press f.   of course, there are

if you work with settings, you                  need to know that the settings interface doesn't work                  quite properly in the following way:    it's a web page-like interface but                  there some controls that don't work as they should.   i                  tried to activate two buttons today and i couldn't do so                  in browse mode using nvda.   i don't know what jaws                  does.   i had to manually go into forms mode, and                  activate the buttons.   i may have had to tab to the                  button because forms mode may not have been properly                  calibrated with browse mode in that interface, at least                  at times.          i seem to recall that in another                  instance, i needed to be in browse mode to activate                  something but i'd have to experiment more to know if                  that is the case since i don't have a clear memory of                  whether that was necessary.          there's a very useful settings search                  feature in settings.          one of my main objections to chrome                  in the past was that the book marks interface is not                  nearly as comvenient to work with as firefox because the                  search feature in chrome book marks appears to be                  inaccessible.   i very recently learned from someone on a                  list i follow that this problem can be more or less                  eliminated.   i say more or less because i haven't played                  with it much, but enough to see that it works well or                  reasonably well.   i'm hedging because i'd want to play                  with it more before saying just how well it works.   it'                  appears to work well from the very little testing i've                  done.   if you are in the address bar, you can type some                  or all of what you want to find such as york times or                  new york times and you can up and down arrow through                  results.   some of them will be search results using a                  search engine but the top results in the list should be                  from book marks and history.   try reading the current                  line after typing to see if that contains the first                  result.   i haven't played with the feature more than a                  little and i'm not sure.   but if it works well, this                  would eliminate what i consider to be an important                  deficiency. in other words, this feature may make book                  marks just as easy to use in chrome as in firefox.          if you use firefox extensions that                  you consider important and use them a lot, that may be a                  consideration in which browser you want to use.   and                  then, there's just convenience of not learning a new                  interface and continuing to use the familiar firefox.                    you, of course, can determine questions like that.   it's                  nice to have pages load a good deal faster, but the                  importance of speed may vary from user to user.   but if                  you haven't compared with a hands on test, you may wish                  to.          browsing is either identical or                  nearly identical between the browsers because they both                  use browse mode, or the virtual pc cursor, which is the                  jaws name for the same thing.          so you can compare by installing                  chrome, and then opening and using some web sites.                    control l moves you to the address bar, just as in                  firefox.   i believe when you open chrome, you are                  automatically placed on the address bar, but you can                  check.   if you want to make sure, it takes almost no                  time to execute control l.          i hope those who are interested in                  this subject find these comments useful.     if people are curious or dissatisfied

default browser for a while now, and have just     bought a chromebook to boot. i love both.          one of the coolest shortcuts i've found in chrome is alt enter: with a page     open you navigate to the omnibar (the address bar) and type a search. when you     press alt enter it opens what you just searched for in a new tab without you     having to close your current web page.          needless to say i am a chrome convert.          it also works extremely well with my   mindspace      client, far better than firefox did when i tried it last (about a month ago).     mindspace involves lots of multilayered sounds and lots of dynamic page     creation with javascript which chrome's v8 javascript engine handles with     ease, far faster than firefox's spidermonkey i think it's called.          while the above was of course a shameless plug, if you do decide to have a     look at mindspace please be aware that it is pre-alpha, and as such isn't     anywhere near complete.          hth,          chris        on 15/05/2018 02:01, kenny wrote:         thanks for sharing the proper shortcut.          i'm curious why hasn't nvda been configured to speak these

      annoyances with current firefox is figuring out when downloads are           finished or when a page is refreshing itself, ie you normally hear the           ticks   in the old version due to navigational   sounds.    until i find a browser with this function of sound           i'm loathe to get a new browser over ff52, but the problem is that i've           been reading that some sites now do not support the old versions of           firefox and tell you so when you have things like modal windows whatever           they are.    on xp to make firefox perform even reasonably you           need to use a version 45, as after this the actual load up times are           hugely slowed, my guess is that the code is made for multi           processor   devices, not single core ones.this is also why on xp you           might find that chrome and firefox are similar in page loading           times.          things are no pushing ahead so fast on sites that its           not uncommon to see the message you browser is unsupported get this or           that then you can come back.    to me this is a weird thing for commercial sites to           do, as they are, in effect pushing away potential customers, but hey,           that is their business.    brian           bglists@...     sent via blueyonder.    please address personal e-mail to:-     briang1@... , putting 'brian

chrome.   at this           point, i've changed my mind and, unless things change over time, as they           may as firefox continues to implement its new internal technical           changes, i consider chrome to be superior for general browsing. i           haven't tested it for uses such as streaming or rss or other uses.             i will therefore only address general browsing and the interface.             others may want to comment on other aspects i haven't           compared.          this is a long message, a bit of a review and a bit           of discussion of the interface.   i hope those interested in the           subject find it useful.          if you try chrome and find it superior for general           browsing, you may still not want to use chrome as your main           browser.   there are various considerations.   i'll explain why           i changed my mind and what you may want to consider.   you may have           other or different considerations as well.          the reason i say chrome is better for general           browsing is because it loads pages faster than firefox.   you may           want to compare and see if the difference is important to you.             there is a very noticeable difference.   i hadn't compared chrome           with firefox for speed on a fast machine.   i compared them on a           slow machine running xp perhaps six or eight months ago.   i had           expected that, if chrome was faster, there would have been a noticeable           difference, even though the machine was slow.   but there wasn't a           difference that amounted to anything.          i recently decided to compare on a reasonably fast           machine running windows 7 since many people have said on lists i'm on           that chrome is faster.   there is a very noticeable difference in           speed on my windows 7 machine.   i don't know what the results would           have been on a fast xp machine.          i haven't used chrome much but the increase in speed           is the reason i say it's better for general browsing.          the chrome interface is different than firefox or           internet explorer.   it isn't difficult to learn but it is           different.   you will likely want a tutorial or some instructional           material.   if you are good at learning by exploring, you may not           want or need such material, at least not to use in depth, but you may           benefit in early learning by using material.          the main things to know in terms of the differences           in the interface are that chrome shows many things as web pages, such as           settings and history and there is one menu, which you can open with alt           f, that is, hold alt and press f.   of course, there are submenus           and there are also items that open like web pages such as           settings.          i don't recall if there are classic dialogs that open           from the main menu.    but if you work with settings, you need to know that           the settings interface doesn't work quite properly in the following           way:    it's a web page-like interface but

"2715","an updated text tutorial on using the chrome browser with nvda and jaws","""          hi all,  here, posted right in the message, is a very short, but comprehensive text tutorial on using the chrome browser with nvda or jaws. they both work the same.  i hope you get a lot out of this. i carefully put on each line what my computer says as i work in the settings page of chrome, and i go through the chrome menu.  here is the tutorial right below.  tutorial for using the google chrome browser  this tutorial will be done with the latest update of chrome.  i will also use jaws 18 and nvda 2017.2for this tutorial, because they both work the same in chrome.  finally, i will use windows 10 creators update latest public build.  i will assume that you have downloaded and installed chrome.  there should be a shortcut on your desktop.  first, i will launch chrome. we will not create a home page until we get to the chrome settings web page.  this is a lot like the options page in firefox, or the options dialog in ie.  pressing the alt key, opens the one and only, chrome menu, with many choices that i will arrow down through.  the first very important step, is to press windows+up arrow to maximise the window. chrome often opens with the window not maximise, and you will get undesirable results.  i will press the alt key.  the chrome menu is open.  i will press insert+up arrow to hear the first option in this menu.  new tab, ctrl+t.  you can press that command right from the web site you are on.  new window, ctrl+n  you can press these commands right from your web page, instead of coming here.  new incognito window.  history sub menu.  i will press right arrow here to see what is in this sub menu!  history, ctrl+h  so, there is a key command for reading your history.  you can read a few sites you were on right here.  i will press left arrow to close this history sub menu.  downloads, ctrl+j  there is the command for opening your downloads you have downloaded with chrome.  next, the important bookmarks sub menu.  i will press right arrow, to open this.  i hear, bookmark this page, ctrl+d  that command will bookmark the page you are reading.  next down arrow, says show bookmarks bar, ctrl+shift+b  that command, will show your bookmarks on your chrome browser for all to see. i do not want that.  here is the important one.  manage bookmarks  the command is, ctrl+shift+o  in here, you can organize your bookmarks into folders, see the bookmarks you have imported from different browsers, and very importantly, you can download, to your computer, an html file of all of your bookmarks in chrome.  on your computer, you can press enter on this file, after it downloads, and a page will show up in chrome with a list of all bookmarks you have saved in chrome. this is an awesome way to download all of your bookmarks right to your computer, so you can back them up.  that is all for manage bookmarks.  next, i hear import bookmarks and settings.  press enter on this, and you can import all bookmarks and settings from ie, and firefox, right into google chrome, and they will be in their corresponding folders.  now, i hear all of my saved bookmarks as i continue to arrow down.  very important!  sometimes, when i open that bookmarks sub menu, i do not land on the choices i mension here, but instead, i start hearing my saved bookmarks. if this happens, i press up arrow a few times, and it gets me to these choices.  keep in mind, that many of these choices, like bookmark manager, have key commands, so you do not have to come to this bookmarks sub menu at all. you only need to come here most of the time, to arrow through your saved bookmarks, and enter on the desired one.  the next few are very self explanatory.  the next one i will mension, is the more tools submenu.  i will press right arrow on this.  i hear save page as, and the command, ctrl+s.  next, save to desktop.  this allows you to save the favorite of the page right to your desktop. this is how you do this in chrome, instead of doing this in the file menu in ie.  it is hidden under this more tools submenu.  clear browsing data, and there is the key command, ctrl+shift+delete key.  extentions, in here, you can add extentions, delete extentions and so on.  these are the same as add ons, in ie.  they are called extensions in chrome.  the last two that i will mention, are settings, and the help sub menu.  now, we will press enter on settings, and a web like page will open where the virtual cursor will turn on with jaws, and nvda will be in brows mode.  first, on this page, there is an edit field to search for a setting to change.  you can simply press enter to get into forms mode with jaws or focus mode with nvda, and sign into chrome with your email and password associated with your google account.  this is very accessible now; a year ago, it was not.  now, you can press enter on sync.  there is a combo box here, and i chose to sync everything that i bookmark and my history in chrome to all devices. i can get on another computer, and all of my bookmarks are on that second computer, for example. that is very powerful.  you can import bookmarks and settings here, just like you could under the bookmarks sub menu.  now, we have a series of headings, that you can just press h for heading, to get to.  now, under the appearance heading, you first have themes, which i did nothing with.  next, you can open the chrome web store. you can get hundreds of extentions, and more.  show home, here is where you can see what you set your home page to.  now, there are two radio buttons, and i chose the one to enter with a custom web address.  now, go to the search engin heading.  this is a heading.  there are headings on this settings page.  i chose to use google search engin in the address bar. this is a combo box.  the next heading, is on start up.  finally, here is where you set up your home page.  there are three radio buttons here.  i chose the third one, to open a selected page or selected pages.  next, i was able to enter:  www.google.com.  that is my home page that will open each time i start chrome.  next, you get to the heading advanced settings.  you have to press enter on this, to open it up, because it is collapsed.  as soon as you press enter, you down arrow to:  privacy and settings heading.  each of these buttons, say clickable.  here, press enter to check, or to uncheck.  when you press enter, you will hear jaws go into forms mode and nvda go into focus mode, so just press enter again. so really, you press enter twice to check, or enter twice to uncheck.  next, there is:  passwords and forms heading.  press enter twice here on each clickable button to check or to uncheck.  languages, i do nothing with that.  downloads.  this is where you set where you want your downloads to go, and you can set whether you want to be prompted each time you download something.  i definitely want the prompt.  i do nothing with the printing or accessibility headings.  the system heading, you can turn on or off open proxy settings.  lastly, there is the reset heading, with a button to enter on that will reset chrome back to its default settings.  that is it for settings.  notice, we made a lot of changes under the advanced settings. you cannot see these, unless you press enter to expand these.  now, just press ctrl+f4 or ctrl+w to get out of this settings page, and go back to google chrome. the settings page, opens in a new tab in chrome, that is why you can press ctrl+f4 or ctrl+w to get out of it.  now, press the alt key again. up arrow once to get to the end of the menu where we were with the settings.  you see exit, up arrow and you see the help sub menu, right under the settings choice.  i press right arrow on this help sub menu, and you can enter on the help center to get a lot of help using chrome.  to open a web site, just press ctrl+l or alt+d and type the url.  chrome for me, is so much quicker with web sites that involve streamming tv and watching movies, and so on.  for me, chrome opens large news sites very quickly compared to ie.  lastly, all jaws and nvda navigation key commands work in chrome. for example, you can press f7 to open a list of links with jaws, and the elements list with nvda. all of that is the exact same.  this is the end of the tutorial.  david moore  sent from  mail  for windows 10         ""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"2901","announcing project pylennium porting nvda code base dependencies and developer attitudes to python 3.6.x","""          ladies and gentlemen,      some of you have been asking nv access and the global nvda community regarding porting nvda source code and dependencies to python 3. i and some contributors have been brainstorming best ways to accomplish this, and nv access, contributors, some add-on writers, users, and nvda observers agree that it is important that we look into eventually porting nvda to python 3.      until recently, the possibility of moving nvda to python 3 seemed to be only a dream. however, a major hurdle was overcome earlier this year when wxpython 4 alpha was released, promising support for python versions 2.7 and 3.x. apart from a major problem regarding certain internal routines from wxpython 4 that may not be compatible with nvda source code, the stage is almost set to begin our transition to python 3, dubbed    project pylennium   .      project pylennium is a new project i   m planning and working on that should make it easier for nv access, code contributors, add-on writers, users and many others to experience smooth transition to python 3. the overall goal of this project is to prepare nvda   s source code so it can run on both python 2 and 3 in most cases until developers are ready to move on. this project also seeks to uncover possible compatibility issues for nvda community when the transition happens, and to document these findings so it can serve as guidelines to current and future developers.      the current iteration of project pylennium (based on nvda github issue 7105 as a roadmap) can be found on my copy of nvda source code at:   https://github.com/josephsl/nvda   the branch to use is    py3000   .      project pylennium involves the following:       gather dependencies required for python 3 transition, such as newer versions of python, configobj and many others. a crucial dependency is the six module, which adds compatibility layer functions for both python 2 and 3.  document porting notes, which will eventually be published on our nvda community wiki.  create source-level compatibility layer in order to mitigate changes in module names, standard library folder structure, function and class names and so on.  migrate most code to python 3 syntax.  frequent and regular testing to make sure regressions are not introduced.       progress so far:       imports: a compatibility layer is in place to import python 2 or 3 version of winreg, pickle, io.stringio and what not.  compiles fine via scons 2.x.  possible to see the first initialization phase of nvda launcher (nvda.pyw) via command line. the biggest showstopper at this time is the fact that loghandler.streamhandler constructor uses file function when python 3 says it isn   t available, which suggests we need to modernize log handler module.       benefits:       allows nv access to look at porting data and make informed decisions.  allows contributors and python experts to provide expertise and prepare the source code for python 3 transition.  allows add-on authors to look at changes and prepare their add-ons to run on python 3.  allows interested users to be involved in a major project and provide test data.       disadvantages:       we need to part ways with windows xp and server 2003.  stress throughout the project, as it is nothing like what we   ve seen recently.  some add-ons will need community intervention to get them to run on python 3, as some are abandonware (no longer maintained by authors or the add-ons community don   t know who wrote some of them and lost contact with some authors).  possible issues in code and other ones, especially when looking at code and attitude conflicts.       next steps:       i   m looking for volunteers and subproject leads: if you are passionate about python, nvda, and want to help nvda achieve the next milestone, please help and find folks who can assist in this project. in regards to subprojects, mostly have to do with dependency checks and tests, testing, documentation, talking to python software foundation (psf), recruiting python experts and what not.  cooperation: as project pylennium is a grand-scale project, we cannot move forward and make it a reality unless cooperation between developers, add-on authors, users, observers and many others is there.  promote: one way to keep the momentum going is promoting this project far and wide.  continued work: i   m looking into how to port urllib imports, as this module has seen huge folder restructuring in python 3 and other work.       what you   ll need for this project:       python 3.6.0 32-bit or later (3.6.2 is recommended).  wxpython 4 alpha 3 or later with the wheel for python 3.5 or 3.6.  six module (from pypi).  configobj 5.0.6.       guidelines:       when sending pull requests, please do not send them to nv access yet, as folks over there are working on high priority work. instead, send a pull request against josephsl/nvda branch py3000.  please provide a clear commit message when sending in pull requests so folks can track what has changed.  before you commit, please make sure to test nvda in order to catch regressions and write workarounds.  at least once a month, i will merge nv access master branch to keep the code up to date and incorporate changes into this project, sometimes requiring transforming syntax to fit python 3 requirements.  if you want to port add-ons, please do so at your earliest convenience or when you are ready. as part of this work, i myself will port my own add-ons to python 3 (one of them is done; throughout this year, i   ll port rest of my add-ons). please do not port your add-ons to python 3 completely     i recommend making it so it   ll run happily on both python versions.       thank you.  sincerely,  joseph     ""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"3070","anti virus",""" well just for the heck of it i googled the question this is the first answer i got.   http://askbobrankin.com/can_a_virus_really_destroy_your_hard_drive.html   now viruses are not the most destructive things that can go wrong.  ransomware is a little higher but the worst viruses are those that have configured or have misconfigured systems.  people assume that the default is good and it may not be.  often when i have recieved a system for maintaining i go through their programs list, malware scan the system, update drivers and bios then ask about them what is this, what is it used for.  9 times out of 10 i get, a site told me it was good, or a friend told me it was good or it came from the system, or i couldn't afford program x and the x place said i needed y z program and i can't buy it so i had to crack it and now i have a virus or something so i loeded 20 programs to get rid of it.  firstly, if someone is telling you you need x program you probably do.  you can probably get round with another program unless you need the spaciffic functionality, look at microsoft office.  yes i'd like it, no i don't need it.  true i loose outlook but i have thunderbird, firefox, openoffice and others, i have jarte for my word processer, etc, etc.  next, while there are a lot of bad hackers out there, a lot are actually putting those skills to good use, for as many comercial programs out there there is probably an opensource app which may do some if not all the functions or bits.  in the beginning i had a professional cd creating program, i couldn't afford it so like most of us in the 90s i cracked it.  later on with all the crazyness going round i looked for what i needed.  goldwave cost me 40 bucks but had a cd extracter in it.  i got a reasonably expensive ocr solution and also a video converter suite.  i have a free youtube software on top of that and a free cd creation program, and there are other ways.  i had winzip for ages because it was the best but i always had to get past the reg screen so i hacked that.  now after it became inaccessible i use 7zip which does the same thing but is faster.  you don't always find what you want especially when a free program goes bust sometimes but there are ways to get round as long as you can throw the bulky suite away and use 5 different modules.  you have to adapt.  next if you get it came with the system.  then read the forking manual, search it online and you will probably find that most of what it came with the system crap is just crap.  and if not it needs to be configured or it can be removed if absolutely not needed.  there are bits of crap i choose to leave on my system that control sensors and power and the like but i know i could have done with the minimal.  the only things you really need are the drivers for your core pc devices, prodcessers, video, sound and thats it.  storage is good, and your usb ports.  over that sensors if they have anything maybe network cards and utilities for the sensors.  if you are a hunking programmer or a guy that wants to fiddle with his bits then install the big utility suite, and some extras.  and if you want the backup program and like it install and buy that.  if you don't mind the games install those and whatever.  if you are in a business and can use accessibly the remote app and the other sharing use them.  most users won't need that stuff.  you will never need the office trials, the wild tangent games or the outdated programs, trials and other junk installed on a system.  if someone said i heard it from a friend or a site, i usually look at it myself.  now if its a friend and you know they used it and it was good fine but even so.  its like the person that says windows10 made my system not work and so i will sue ms because i had to buy another one.  the only time that happens with me or those i maintain is if the system is so old, fixing it would end up with it probably failing later and so i push for a replacement or modification.  maybe i shouldn't bother fixing systems maybe i should buy some ransomware that basically says your files are encripted because your computer is broken, please give me 5000 dollars to buy you another one.  i wander how many would fall for it.  i suspect a lot.  its a shame we a re so gullable!!!

"3148","anti virus recommendations",""" you know, there is an article or several at  http://technology.jaredrimer.net   all on this issue.  the main blogger aggrees with me.  most of the antimalware, intrusion protection, antivirus, and other so called security software is simply not accessable, though some of it may be at the current time.  for myself if it was just me, i'd buy something my issue is that i have several users, that can't afford cash, i could technically handle sophos i suppose but these users don't want to be bogged down with computer errors.  they don't get the same time as i do and or enjoy what the network has to offer.  in other words, while i have set as much to automate, they should get monthly or bymonthly updates.  i service their workstations and server units once a year just after christmas.  i have a couple days to defrag hdds, update existing software, run antimalware and kill software, fix user issues, and other things.  as well as fixing their clicking stuff they think was genuine and not clicking stuff that was.  its not enough to really secure a system with a 1-2 day window.  especially since its one week in a year and it needs to be working perfectly.  msse means that for the most part i can have my cake and eat it.  if i could ownly know that whatever i chose would stay in ratings, continued to be accessible and would not cause major issues i'd go to that in a heartbeat.  oh and if it was low work to service and  either had a free or lifetime subscription for up to 5-10 units, and not to many false positives.  these users are busy people they don't have time to talk to me all the time and they want their units to work.  while sophos may fit the bill what happens if it dropps off ratings or changes interface, etc.  in short i am vary much suspecting that security software companies are ignoring our small userbase.  after using msse i found babysitting security software is a  big issue and now i don't have to do it well.  i have blogged and other such things, and before you start owning my ass as a lot of you seem to do, you tell me how we can get these guys to do something in general.  we have no cash to force the law and i am really not sure if that will even help.  there is no reason for them for example to be not inaccessible.  there are off the shelf libraries that incorperate screen readers at their core.  one of them is tolque which teamtalk's qt interface uses.  granted teamtalk was accessible in the first place, but there are enough libs and stuff out there that if they didn't want to write an addon for jaws they could probably get away with doing that.  what can we do to ensure that programs use standard controls.  we almost have some sort of rating system and database of inaccessible programs and accessible ones and reviews of those.  i am still not convinced that that would even help.  its been a stumbling block for a long, long time.  i won't go into details that site has all the details.  you have heard me once and you hear me again, it is a rant into the fires of nothingness.  as threats come up, this gets discussed with no change in site.  even when those at avast told us they would get us past the capchas they had that wasn't really the point.  its why we have to have programs to crack captchas just to get the stupid things to work.  and if we can get past those others can.  on the other hand in most cases audio captchas including recaptcha have got a little better and in fact some can even be played back unlimited times at least more than twice or so and be downloadable as simple mp3 files.  for me a security program should have a simple menu or web page interface similar to old avg or msse.  one tab for scan, one for quarenteen, one tab  for settings and one for protection.  you could even put protection in settings.  you could put quarenteen in a history of everything tab.  so 2-3 tabs and its simple.  maybe an update tab, 4 tabs.  its all you need if you can't be bothered.  either that or we need some way to have an accessible interface to the net to run some sort of cloud system where you don't have to touch the software similar to sophos but can run it offline in an on demand mode if you wish.  i have issues submitting to much online in the background if you don't have to.  its another part of your privacy gone, pluss it wastes bandwidth and thats quite important with costs like they are.

"3655","attention windows 10 app essentials users pilot development channel fall release requirements legacy code being removed","""          dear nvda community:      for those on nvda users and add-ons lists: a few days ago i announced project hidden singer/big bang, a project to restructure code in windows 10 app essentials and say goodbye to old workarounds. this is partly motivated by the fact that, with nvda 2017.3, features from this add-on will make their debut as part of the screen reader itself, so the add-on is no longer required for some major tasks. the below announcement is just a first step in this project, with the complete picture emerging by september 2017.      announcement text:      as part of nvda 2017.3, nv access, together with joseph lee, a windows insider and a noted nvda expert in united states, have developed a set of features designed to improve user experience for windows 10 users using nvda. prior to the upcoming release, an add-on called windows 10 app essentials have included features such as sounds to indicate appearance of search suggestions, announcing top search suggestion in braille and various workarounds for windows 10 and various universal apps. joseph, the author of the windows 10 app essentials, is delighted to announce that these features will be part of upcoming nvda 2017.3, scheduled to hit the air sometime in august 2017.      as part of this work, i (joseph lee) would like to announce three important things:       a fall release of windows 10 app essentials add-on will require nvda 2017.3. this will be in place no later than october 2017.  for those using nvda snapshots (master and/or next), a new    pilot development    channel will be introduced. you may occasionally hear references to    try builds   ,    fast ring snapshots    and what not, but in context of this add-on, it all refers to the pilot channel. this channel will not show up in update channel list, as this channel is designed to receive continuous feedback i.e. this channel requires nvda snapshots. anyone using development channel of this add-on along with nvda master or next snapshots will be moved to this channel, as code in this channel parts ways with compatibility layer code, as changes made to nvda snapshots will be reflected in these builds. if you are using windows 10 app essentials development snapshots under nvda stable (2017.2, for example), you   ll stay in development channel (sometimes called    slow ring   ) in order to preserve compatibility layer routines.  speaking of snapshot combinations: starting from june 28 th  wintenapps snapshot, those on pilot development channel will get a build that is equivalent to nvda next snapshots. this snapshot removes compatibility layer in place for search suggestion announcement, as this is no longer required if you are on latest master and/or next snapshots as nvda itself will handle this for you.       thank you.  cheers,  joseph     ""","original","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"

"3680","attention windows xp vista users using firefox firefox 52 will likely be the last one to support these versions of windows","""                 it isn't a question of which is more simple.     it's a question of prefering one interface to the other.   and it isn't a   question of how the modes work, but and the preference is for how you switch   between modes such as object and screen review.   it's a question of how to   move between flat review, which is now called screen review and object   review.   it's not worth changing versions because of this minor   difference.   but since i don't need the newer features or functionality of   nvda, i continue to use the old version.   i don't know the download link   for the old version, if there is one.              if you want to know the difference between screen   review and object review, there is at least one tutorial that covers the matter   as a topic or subtopic.   when not using screen review, you should make sure   to change the setting back to object review.   not doing so will cause   things like read current line not to work correctly some of the time.                   you can look at the different topics covered in the   tutorial at       http://www.nvda-kr.org/en/               it appears that the following sections would be   relevant to your questions:      nvda tutorial #3 part 1 - introduction to objects,   system focus and caret versus navigator object and review cursor, object   navigation and review cursor commands.  nvda tutorial #3 part 2 - review   modes, mouse, touchscreen navigation revisited.              i haven't looked at the tutorial to any extent so i   don't know if any other sections might have a bearing on the subject but those   appear to be the two main relevant sections.   use the tutorial with recent   or current versins of nvda.   i don't recall what version of windows you are   using but my old version won't work well, if at all in windows 10.   i don't   know how well it works in windows 8.                 gene     ""","following","tagged",NULL,"undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","undefined","Junk"
