""          hi.      it is very important to distinguish that nvda is not, and i repeat not, responsible for the processing of numbers. all this functionality is controlled by the synthesizer of choice. in certain locales and regions, the period (or full stop) symbolizes the decimal point. after it is encountered, numbers are read by single digits by most synthesizers. eloquence, with the american english setting, will pronounce the 0 as an    o    as that is common in north america. i haven   t seen espeak do this any at all.      sent from  mail  for windows 10             """,Answer

1144,1145,access teaching and concepts for blind use of computers was cutting and pasting from wordpad to word in various modes,"access teaching and concepts for blind use of computers was cutting and pasting from wordpad to microsoft word in various modes "" just catching up on this one.  the problem was highlighted recently when i needed someone specifically to help me interpret what a sighted user was actually doing into my keyboard orientated world. you are right that most sighted users not only do not know the keyboard shortcuts, but worse, do not understand the concepts of what they are actually doing when  dragging files about and selecting folders to put stuff in, many just accepting defaults set up on an install. this comes to a head when a sighted relative uses a blind configured computer as they may use a click that reset something you had painstakingly altered, many months back and since they do not tell you you then need to fiddle for ages to get your functionality back.    all of these things are windows, not screenreader commands, normally.  i notice that in supernova, there is a separate chapter on windows conventions and shortcuts and how different settings of windows can affect the user like us.  i guess the single and double click alterations is one of the main ones that gets moved quite often.      unfortunately, in all the different flavours of windows, the way to get at settings changes somewhat.  i also have issues with concepts when they change. i do not like ribbon menus for blind use. i have had them explained until steam is coming out of a tutors ears, but as i learned on logical normal pull down menus. ribbons seems a bit of a mess, putting all sorts of things i have thought were different, together in one big 'pudding'. so toolbars, property sheets sub menus and all sorts of stuff comes up unexpectedly as the brain has partitioned these objects as different things not likely to be in the menu system directly.    i use things like control/shift no for new folder which seems to be something my sighted colleagues never even knew was possible and the like, so, i guess i have a foot in many camps and the challenge is to attempt to cater for people like me who do not like change to concepts. that is one reason i do not like the new apps in windows 10, as they seem to be a step back in time to a non standard  as you like approach to software we had in the old dos days. if we can no longer rely on finding things where we always used to, it will be very hard to teach anyone how to use them if the interface changes every time an update comes out.      its about time that accessibility was not just seen as, yes you can get at and operate a button or control, but that there needs to be some underlying logic and short cut key set everyone uses. its like many web sites which claim to be accessible as everything reads, but its so big and messy that without an overview as the sighted has, the poor old blind user is completely at sea as to what else might be on the page in a stupid place.  i feel better now.  brian    bglists@...  sent via blueyonder.  please address personal email to:-  briang1@..., putting 'brian gaff'  in the display name field.

""                 it is a good idea for people who are blinded as   adults to learn enough braille, grade one, to be specific, to label things and   organize things.   children should learn braille just as sighted children   learn print.   but i am unconvinced that the argument that braille is just   like print in terms of everyone who is blind learning it.   that is not a   proper analogy.                 for one thing, and i haven't seen any research on   this but, despite what braille proponents say, i remain unconvinced that braille   is nearly as good a medium as speech for many blind people in terms of ongoing   general use.   i was always annoyingly slow at reading braille.   even   in my early adult years, i learned braille as a child, and in my early adult   years, i would read about 300 braille pages a month, i never got faster than   about between 180 and 200 words a minute.   considering that i can listen to   speech at between 350 and 400 words a minute with good comprehension, the   contrast in efficiency is obvious.   and why didn't my speed increase over   time, reading as much braille as i did for about ten years?   why do so many   blind people i hear read braille read only about as fast as they speak,   resulting in pauses and stumbling over words as they read?                 some people can read braille very quickly.   my   observations and experience cause me to be skeptical that most blind people read   faster than about 180 or 200 words per minute.  i'm talking about people who   learn to read braille as children at the age sighted children learn to read   print.                  and reading braille was always more work and more   tiring and fatiguing for me than  listening to speech, a lot more so.     yet i have been innundated with the you should read braille and with the implied   message that if i don't, i am  somehow using an inferior medium.     if  that's true, then let's get substantive information, real studies of   some sort showing that i am wrong in my observations.            i said earlier that blind children should learn   braille and they should.   they should use it in school, at least in grammar   school so they learn proper spelling, punctuation, and learn to distinguish   between words that sound similar or alike and mean different things and are   spelled differently.   how many times have i seen blind people  write   wander instead of wonder?   just one example.                 and obviously, braille is of vital importance in   technical fields.    but the general assumption that braille is   better  for blind people as an unqualified generalization for daily and   general use, has not been demonstrated to be correct in  my observations and   experience.                  we are blind and, like it or not, being blind means   that the analogical equivalent to something sighted people do, braille to print,   is not necessarily better or as good as a specifically blind oriented solution   for many uses.                 gene     """,Junk

"" the cost of braille displays is (mostly) what the market will bear.   i know they claim it's the technology used to raise and lower the pins, but i can buy those pizo membrane things for $1.50 each from parallax.com, and i'm sure if a braille display manufacturer bought them in high volume, they would be less than a dollar a piece.   sure, you need six or eight of them per cell, but that's still not 100 dollars a cell like they claim.   now, keep in mind, i've never built a braille display, and i don't know what else goes into them, but the pizo electric cells themselves aren't all that expensive anymore.   we won't get decent portable braille production until someone builds a new brailler.   with all the available technology these days, there's absolutely no reason for a brailler to be anywhere near as bulky as they are today.   even the supposedly redesigned braillers aren't much smaller than the perkins braillers, and that's just silly.   ideally, someone would make a brailler that can double as a display, but until that happens, we're stuck with what exists.

4726,4727,browsing hierarchical tree of comments,"browsing hierarchical tree of comments "" hi everyone,    many websites have tree-like structure of comments. for  example, reddit, hacker news, and probably a lot more websites are  like this. sometimes i would like to read some comments, but for  example i would like to read only the top-level comments, and not the  deeper levels, because that would be the replies to the top-level  comments, and they are typically not as interesting. is there any way  to achieve this with nvda?    so, for example, i would like to have a key combination to jump to the  next same level comment. right now i can only jump to the next comment  of any level by searching a keyword ('up vote' or something, that  appears next to every comment), and then i'd have to deduce in my mind  what level comment is this. it is very tedious to browse comments this way.    another way that might help me would be to figure out the level of the  current comment. at least i'd be able to move down through the  comments without reading them and without trying to deduce its level  from the contents.    i can use firefox, chrome and internet explorer, so i'd be happy to find a solution that works in any of these browsers.    any advice would be appreciated!  tony """,Junk

4729,4730,browsing hierarchical tree of comments,browsing hierarchical tree of comments i've been playing with nvda and just discovered a simple solution: press insert + numpad delete twice (report review corsor location) and it will tell you the distance from the left microsoft edge of the screen. the greater the distance - the deeper the level of the comment.      i think in theory something can be done on the client side to make the comments more readable for screenreader users.. you can write a browser plugin that would modify a page to include the level of the comment explicitly for example. but this is only in theory: my knowledge of java script/html/css is too poor to write it myself.      tony,Answer

4763,4764,browsing with edge,"browsing with microsoft edge "" hi all,  i have spent the last five hours doing more research with windows 10. i am using nvda 2016.1, and the latest version of the nvda add on, windows 10 apps essentials. using these tools, here is what i have figured out concerning microsoft microsoft microsoft edge. i can open the microsoft microsoft edge. i can press alt+d and type in a search or a particular web site address. i type in www.google.com to do my searches in google. i can use object navigation to read the entire web page and use some short cut keys like h for heading, and e for edit box and so on. i can press ctrl+enter to open a link in a new tab and navigate and read that site easily with object navigation. using the brows mode with arrow keys works okay, but using object navigation works much better, because the page seems to read a lot faster. for example, if i press ctrl+nvda+right and left arrows to read microsoft word by microsoft word with the review corsor, it is a lot more snappy than just using ctrl+left and right arrow keys. i can use object navigation to access all of the buttons like the       more       button. i do the command to bring the mouse pointer to the place of the review corsor, and left click on my touch pad on my laptop. many buttons then come into view including the settings button. using object navigation, i can change all of my settings to the way i want them. for example, i just put in the url that i want opened when microsoft edge is launched. i can read my favorites list, and press ctrl+d to add a web page to my favorites. i can read all results that cortana puts in the microsoft microsoft edge. jaws cannot do any of this that i have described at all with microsoft edge. i must say that microsoft edge is not accessible at all with jaws, but it is very accessible for me so far with what i have done, with nvda and having the windows 10 essentials add on. this is very exciting, because all who use nvda can at least do the basics in the microsoft microsoft edge already. i just wanted all nvda users to know this. i read the nvda web sites in the microsoft microsoft edge with no problems using nvda. take care all. windows 10 is getting more and more accessible every day, it seems like, and i am excited for all of us. so, with nvda, everything i mentioned so far is accessible in the microsoft microsoft edge and i haven't tried many things yet with the microsoft microsoft edge. maybe you do not need a microsoft account. try all of the apps, including microsoft edge, and see if you can use them without an microsoft account. have a great one.

4832,4833,bug in browsemode,"bug in browsemode "" hi sally,    thanks for your message. yes i guess you brought it to the point.  the question would have to be looked at more globally then.    sorry gene, did not want to fool you, only did understand you wrong so far. :-)    so, another try to get a step further ...    going back to start with my example of the messenger thread ...    1. when i want to read it message by message the simplest way (i guess) is to jump to the next unlinked textblock, as every message starts with the link to the person who wrotes it.    when i do that right now nvda speaks 'space' because the block seems to start with a blank line.    this does not make sense at all, because even if the first line is blank, what sense does it make to tell the user only this?      2. when the key is called 'jump to the next unlinked textblock' why shoult it jump to it and only read the first line? i want to hear the whole block i jump to, it is an object and if i get to this object i want to hear it.  if i jump to a list i can understand if only the list title is read, would be fine with that, as the list item is another object.  allthough i also would prefer to have the whole list read automatically.    3. gene, i do not agree on the 'read all' argument, as i aonly want to have nvda read the textblock, then stop. i agree, if i have turned on read all and then press 'n' that it should jump to the next unlinked text an go on readin from there ...but then also go on after the end of the textblock. (as you said)  but when i press 'n' without read all, it defenitely should read the whole block, as i cannot know how long this block is - and if i press 'n' i want to hear the unlinked text ...  if there would be a second line of unlinked text right after that, i never would get there unless i press 'cursor down' or 'read all' and than would also hear a link if the next line was a link.  so this cannot work properly right now.    i want to read only unlinked text and this is not possible. but it should be possible.    either, 'n' would have to jump to the next line as this is the next unlinked text  or it would have to read the whole block at once.  i guess reading only a line is not what we all want.    if this is nothing everyone sees this way and wants to have to be able to read more comfortable, why not add a check box in the settings: 'read whole object when jumped to'  then everybody could decide to hear only the first line, as it works now, or the whole textblock/list/...    i have no idea how complicated that would be to be realiced, but i guess it's only about two or three lines of code actually (for each, the setting and the function).  even could probably done by an add on?  would have to read more about the development of them.    cheers  martin """,Answer

4834,4835,bug in browsemode,"bug in browsemode ""                 how long is the skipped block?   i've never   seen anything about this in nvda.   jaws skips small blocks of nonlink text   intentionally when using the feature.   also, do you use the find function   and do you use it in such cases as working with an online e-mail client or   internet forums where you may have a reliable item to search for to move to   something like the start of a new message or the body of a new message?     for example, in gmaill, as i recall, you can move efficiently to the start of a   new message using x to move to the next check box.   i don't use gmail,   though i have an account and i played with it a little.   if you want to   move to the start of the body of a message, you could move by check box to move   to the next message, then use the repeat search command to move to whatever the   last line is before the message body starts after you follow the link to open   the new message.                 i don't use gmail and my recollection based on the   small amount of looking and playing around i did may not work well but in such   circumstances, such techniques or similar ones, usually allow me to navigate   well or reasonably well.   i doubt that using the skip to nonlink text   blocks is generally a good command for moving in ways you want to move.   my   understanding of it, from using it regularly is that it is not intended for   granular work.   it is intended to move you to the start of main text on a   page such as the beginning of an article.   it may not do so on many pages   unless you execute it more than once and even so, itg may not move you to just   where you want to be.   the start of many articles are links or almost all a   link such as the link house of representatives, end of link.   because only   one microsoft word is not a link, it may well be that the skip to the next block of plain   text command won't stop there.                         i don't recall what you use for e-mail.     perhaps you have to use a web interface for some reason.   but web   interfaces are not nearly as efficient for blind people to use for e-mail as   e-mail programs are.              also, since i don't work with forums much and i   don't work with e-mail online except very rarely, others may have more   suggestions for how to do so efficiently.   but the command you are trying   to use, as it is generally implemented, not just by nvda, is probably not very   well suited to your purpose.   if you don't use the find command, and other   commands such as x for check box, etc., look for patterns and see if using such   methods works well.              gene     """,Answer
